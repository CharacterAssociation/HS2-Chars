待たせたな。女は色々と面倒なんだ、分かるだろ？=Sorry I kept you waiting. Women can be a pain in the ass. You know that, right?
くだらねぇことに付き合わせちまったな。まぁ、待たせた分はきちんと埋め合わせしてやるからよ。=I'm sorry I kept you waiting for this bullshit. Well, I'll make it up to you for keeping me waiting.
おい、まさか覗いてなんていなかったよなぁ？　妙に視線を感じたんだが、オマエじゃねぇよなぁ？=Hey, you weren't peeking at me, were you? I felt a strange look on my face, but it wasn't you, was it?
チッ、まだいやがったか。さっさと帰っちまえばよかったのによ。=Damn, you're still here. You should've just left.
覗きにこなかったってことは、一人で妄想にでも浸ってたか？　妄想の中のオレは、どんな感じでナニをしてた？=If you didn't come to take a peek, were you alone in your fantasy? What was I like doing in my fantasy?
