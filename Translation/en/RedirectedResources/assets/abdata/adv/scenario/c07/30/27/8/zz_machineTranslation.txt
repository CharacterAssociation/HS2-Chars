おい、なにがしたかったんだ？　ビビってなにもできねぇってか？　情けねぇ。=Hey, what did you want to do? You're too scared to do anything? You're pathetic.
なんだ？　萎えたってやつか？　何が原因だ？　正直に言ってみろ。=What is it? What's with the wilting? What's the cause? Be honest with me.
分からないやつだな。まぁ、気が乗らねぇ時もあるだろうさ。=I don't know, man. Well, there are times when you don't feel like it.
どっか調子がわりぃのか？　それとも、オレが相手じゃ不満ってやつか？=What's wrong with you? Or are you just not happy with me?
おいおい、それはないだろう。こっちの期待はどうしてくれるんだ？　流石に無責任が過ぎるぞ？=Oh, come on, that's not gonna happen. What are you going to do about our expectations? That's a little irresponsible, don't you think?
つまり、これはオレに襲えってことか？　オマエがそういう趣味だってんなら、オレは別に構わねぇが……=So, does this mean you want me to attack you? If that's what you're into, I don't mind, but...
あぁ、それでいい。オマエもようやく、身の程ってもんが分かったようだな。=Yeah, that's good. It looks like you finally understand your place in the world.
ハッ、オマエらしいな。そうやって肝心なとこでビビって、結局オマエは何にもできずに終わるんだろうよ。=Ha, that's just like you. You'll probably end up being too scared to do anything about it in the end.
待て待て、流石にそれは焦らし過ぎだろう。いや、焦らしなんてもんじゃねぇ。ただの嫌がらせだな。=Wait, wait, wait, that's too much of a rush. No, it's not rushing at all. It's just harassment.
なんだ、オレじゃ興奮しないってか？　なら何故呼んだ？　オレに恥をかかせたかっただけなら、ぶっ飛ばされっぞ？=What, you're not excited about me? Then why did you call me here? If you just wanted to humiliate me, you'd get my ass kicked.
どういうことだ？　焦らすにしても程があるだろう。これはただ、オレをイラつかせてるだけだぞ？=What do you mean? You can't rush me like that. You're just trying to get on my nerves.
