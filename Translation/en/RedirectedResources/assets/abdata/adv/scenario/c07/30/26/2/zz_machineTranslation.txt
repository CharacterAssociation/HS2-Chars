おい、ちゃんと身体は綺麗にしてきたか？　臭ぇやつを抱く趣味は無いからな。そこんとこは頼むぜ？=Hey, have you cleaned yourself up yet? I don't like to hold smelly people. I don't have a taste for stinky guys.
オマエ、まだ緊張してんのか？　ったく、情けねぇやつだ。オレを萎えさせるようなことだけはすんなよ？=You're still nervous, huh? Damn, you're pathetic. Don't do anything that will make me faint, okay?
よし来たな。オマエに試してやろうと思ってたことがたくさんあるんだ。今日はとことん付き合ってもらうぞ。=Okay, you're here. There's a lot of things I've been meaning to try on you. Today you're going to be with me the whole way.
またオマエか。いや、別に悪い気はしてねぇが。どんだけオレのことが好きなんだと思ってな。=It's you again. No, I don't feel bad about it. I was just wondering how much you like me.
もう、オレの虜って感じか？　ハッ、ならとことんオレに尽くせ。その分ちゃんと、可愛がってやるからよ。=You're already my prisoner, aren't you? If that's the case, you'd better give me all you can. I'll take good care of you for that.
おいおい、オレはオマエの専属じゃねぇぞ？　オレを本気で落としたいなら、オマエもそれなりの覚悟を決めねぇとな。=Hey, hey, hey, I'm not your exclusive. If you really want to lose me, you have to be prepared to do the same.
なんとなく、オマエに呼ばれる気がしてた。フッ、願ったり叶ったりってやつだな。おら、さっさと始めるぞ。=I had a feeling you'd call me. Well, I guess that's what you get for wishing. Hey, let's get started.
まぁ、オレの相手は、オマエくらいじゃないと務まらないよな。これでも少しは認めてやってるんだ。ありがたく思えよ？=Well, you're the only one who can handle me, aren't you? I'm giving you a little credit for that. You should be grateful for that.
ハッ、オマエも好きモンだな。まぁ、オレもヒトのことは言えねぇが……ここはお互い様ってことにしとくか。=I can't say the same for you. Well, I can't speak for others either, but I guess we're on the same side here.
ほう、いい面構えになってきたじゃねぇか。貪欲になるのはいいことだ。ハッ、飢えたケダモノ同士、喰い合うとするか。=Well, you've got a nice face, haven't you? It's good to be greedy. Ha, let's eat each other, hungry animals.
ふぅん……よくまたオレを呼ぶ気になったな。自分で言うのもなんだが、オレはかなり強欲だぞ？　特に、気持ちよくなることに関してはな。=Hmmm... How did you come to call me again? I'm pretty greedy, if I do say so myself. Especially when it comes to feeling good.
そうか、オマエもただひたすらヤリたいだけのタイプか。気が合うな……オレもなんだ。本気で気持ちよくなるためには、理屈なんて邪魔なだけだからな。=So, you're the type of guy who just wants to get laid. We're kindred spirits... Me too. If you really want to feel good, logic is just a hindrance.
いいね、完全にケダモノの目だ。オレ以外の女とも、相当ヤったのか？　じゃなきゃ、そこまでにはなんねーだろ？=I like it. You have the eyes of an animal. Did you have a lot of sex with other women? Otherwise, you wouldn't be that good, would you?
最初に会った時から、オマエはオレと同じ匂いがすると思ってたよ。ヤってヤってヤリまくって、一生ヤリ続けたいって思ってるだろ？　そう、俺も同じさ。=I knew from the first time I met you that you smelled just like me. You want to fuck and fuck and fuck for the rest of your life, right? Yeah, I'm the same way.
何度でも湧き出してきやがって……本気で害虫みてぇなヤツだな。今度こそ、もう二度とオレを呼びたいなんて思えなくしてやるよ。=You keep coming up again and again... You're a real pest, aren't you? This time, I'll make sure you never want to call me again.
そうか、オマエはアホなんだな？　何を言われても本質は理解できてねぇ。つまり無敵ちゃんてやつだ……ハッ、恐れ入ったぜ。=So, you're an idiot, huh? No matter what you say, you don't understand the essence. So you're invincible... I'm afraid so.
空気が読めねぇやつは二種類いてな。大概は放っておけば孤立してくもんだ。オマエみたいな無駄にアクティブなやつが、一番面倒なんだよ。=There are two kinds of people who can't read the air. Most of them will isolate themselves if you leave them alone. It's the ones like you who are unnecessarily active that are the most troublesome.
根性だけは買ってやる。だがな、身の程ってもんを弁えろ。もう少し分かりやすく言ってやろうか？　オレの迷惑も考えろって言ってんだ。=I'll buy your guts. But you should know your place. Let me put it a little more clearly. I'm asking you to think about the trouble you'll cause me.
このド低能め……言葉で言っても無駄なら、もう身体に教え込むしかないよなぁ。=If it's useless to say it with words, we'll just have to teach it to our bodies.
はぁ、こっちの迷惑も考えずに、無駄にサカリやがって。オマエみたいなクソムシは、どうやって調教したらいいんだ？=Huh, you're wasting your time without even thinking about the trouble I'm in. How can I train a bugger like you?
なんだ、またオレの身体が恋しくなったか？　普通の女よりは好き放題できるからな……色々と都合がいいんだろう？=What, you miss my body again? I can do whatever I want with it, more than most women... It's convenient for you, isn't it?
何をしてもいい。とにかくオレを楽しませろ。何度会っても同じだ。オマエはそれだけ考えて、オレを好きなだけ貪ればいい。=I don't care what you do. Just make me happy. It doesn't matter how many times you see me. It doesn't matter how many times you see me.
よう、これでもオマエには結構期待してるんだ。ビビらねぇで、オレを容赦なく攻められるやつは貴重だからな。=I've got a lot of expectations for you, you know. It's valuable to have someone who can attack me without fear and without mercy.
ハッ、オマエを見ただけで、身体が勝手に反応しやがる。どうしてくれんだ？　オレの身体をこんな風にした責任は、取ってもらうからな？=Ha, just looking at you makes my body react on its own. What are you going to do? You'll have to take responsibility for making my body like this, okay?
フッ、待ってたぞ。待たされて過ぎて、焦らしプレイかと間違えたくらいだ。お詫びにたっぷり、付き合ってもらうぞ。=Huh, I've been waiting for you. You've been waiting so long that I thought you were playing hide-and-seek. As an apology, I'm going to give you a lot of company.
我ながら、面倒な性癖だと思うぞ。それに付き合ってるオマエも、なかなかなモンだがな。まぁ、好きモノ同士、丁度いい組み合わせだろう？=I think it's a troublesome habit for me. I'm sure you're not the only one who goes along with it. Well, it's a good combination of two people who like each other, isn't it?
