おい待て、考え直せ。オレに恩を売っておけば、後々いい思いができるぞ？=Wait, wait, wait. Think again. Why don't you just ingratiate yourself with me, and you'll be in good hands later?
待て待て。少し考えれば分かることだろ？　オレは助けられた恩は忘れない。そういうところは筋通す女だぜ？=Wait, wait, wait. If you think about it, you'll understand. I'll never forget what you did for me. I'm a reasonable woman, you know?
そんなこったろうと思ったよ。オマエに助けられるなんて、こっちから願い下げだ。とっとと消えちまえ。=That's what I thought. I don't want to be saved by you. Get the hell out of here.
おいおい、それは無いだろ？　オレには興味なしってか？　それとも放置プレイのつもりか？=Oh, come on, you don't think so? You're not interested in me? Or are you just going to leave me alone?
