まぁ、二人がかりじゃ流石に分が悪いか。むしろ、これでオレをイカせられなかったら。オマエらかなり微妙だぜ？=Well, it's not so bad when it takes two of you. In fact, if you can't make me cum with this. You guys are pretty sensitive, aren't you?
ハッ、これだけ盛大にイカされると、悔しさも湧いてこねぇ。てか、そもそも二対一だしな。ハンデ付けてやり過ぎだろ。=I can't avoid but feel frustrated when I get fucked this hard. In the first place, it's two against one. It's too much of a handicap.
どうだ？　二人で一緒に、一人の女をイカせた気分は。仲間意識が高まったんじゃないか？=How does it feel? How does it feel to make one woman cum, together? It's a great feeling of camaraderie, isn't it?
二人一気に相手しても、穴兄弟ってことになるのか？　まぁ、どうでもいいことだな。=If I deal with two of you at once, does that mean we're a-holes? Well, it doesn't really matter, does it?
ハッ、オマエら、さぞ気分がいいんだろうな。でも残念、オレもイった後で、かなりいい気分だ。=Ha, you guys must be feeling really good. Too bad, I'm feeling pretty good too, after all I've been through.
おい、なにを勝ち誇った顔をしてやがる。二対一だったんだ、そんなんで喜んでるようじゃ、たかが知れるぜ。=Hey, what's with the triumphant look on your face? It was two against one, you can't be too happy about that.
ほら、オレはイったぞ。これで満足か？=There, I've cum. You happy now?
ふぅ、イったイった。二対一だと、逆に気兼ねなくイケていいな。オレは負けて当然なんだから……だろ？=I came, I came, I came. Two against one, it's nice to be able to cum without worrying about it. I deserved to lose, didn't I?
オマエら、なかなかいいコンビなんじゃねぇか？　その調子で、二人でオレをまた攻め抜いてみせろよ。=You guys make a pretty good team, don't you think? Keep up the good work, and let's see you two attack me again.
なかなかやるじゃないか。オマエら二人とも合格だ。少しは誇っていいぞ？=That's pretty good. You've both passed. You should be a little proud of yourselves.
よし、よくやった。いいチームワークだったな。その調子で、もっとオレを満足させ続けろ。=All right, well done. That was good teamwork. Keep it up, and keep me happy.
