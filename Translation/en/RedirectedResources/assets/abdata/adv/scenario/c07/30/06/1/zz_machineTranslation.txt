まさか、覗きがバレないとでも思ってたのか？　それは流石に、都合よく考え過ぎだろ。=Don't tell me you didn't think you'd be caught peeping? That's just too convenient.
まったく、オマエにそういう趣味があるのは構わねぇが。もう少し節度ってやつを持て。=I don't mind that you have such a hobby. But you should have a little more moderation.
おい、見てるだけで良かったのか？　もっと近くで、匂いとか嗅がせてやっても良かったんだぞ？=Hey, were you allowed to just watch? You could've gotten closer, let me smell you or something.
おい変態。通報されたくなかったら、オレに黙ってぶっ飛ばされろ。=Hey, perv. If you don't want me to call the cops, shut up and let me blow you up.
バレても覗き続けるってのは、大した根性だな。ったく、それをもっと他の方向に生かせ。=You've got a lot of guts to keep peeking even after you've been found out. Damn, you should have used that in a different direction.
おい、いつまで覗いてるつもりだ？　見てるだけで満足なのか？　そうじゃねぇだろ？=Hey, how long are you gonna keep peeking? You're just happy to watch? You're not, are you?
