おい、オレもいるぞ。逃げるなよ？=Hey, I'm here, too. Don't run away, okay?
まるで吸い寄せられるみたいに来やがって、この女好きめ。=It's like I'm being sucked in, you womanizer.
どっちに用があって来たんだ？　オレか？　そっちか？=Which way did you come? Me? Or you?
オレらの邪魔をしに来たんなら、それなりに面白いことをしろよ？=If you're here to interfere with us, why don't you do something interesting?
二人一気に相手しようってか？　それは無謀ってもんだな。=You want to take on two people at once? That's reckless, isn't it?
オレらに嬲られに来たのか？　クソマゾだな。=Did you come here to be tortured by us? You're a fucking masochist.
おい、オマエのせいで雰囲気が悪くなっただろうが。どうしてくれんだ？=Hey, you've ruined the mood, haven't you? What are you going to do about it?
オマエは仲間にいれてやらねぇぞ？　一人で寂しくしてろ。=You're not one of us, are you? You'll be alone and lonely.
おい、ちゃんとオレにも挨拶しろ。礼儀だろ。=Hey, you should say hello to me, too. It's common courtesy.
なんだ？　オレらに苛めて欲しくて来たのか？=What is it? Did you come here because you want us to torment you?
