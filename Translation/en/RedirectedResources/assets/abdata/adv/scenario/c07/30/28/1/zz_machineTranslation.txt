おい、バレてんぞ……コソコソしても無駄だ、ぶっ飛ばされねぇうちに出てけ。=Hey, they know you're here... There's no point in sneaking around, get out before I blow you away.
おい……オマエだオマエ、そこで覗いてる変態に話しかけてんだよ。ったく、バレてねぇとでも思ってたのか？=Hey... It's you... You're talking to the pervert peeking in there. Did you really think I didn't notice?
そこの変態。もうバレちまってんだ。なら開き直っちまうのも手だと思うが……どうすんだ？=Hey, pervert. You've already been exposed. Then I guess you could just open up... What are you going to do?
で？　そこのゴミクズは、いつまでオレを覗いてるつもりなんだ？　熱湯でもぶっかけらんねぇと、分かんねぇか？=So? How long is that piece of trash going to keep peeking at me? How long are you going to keep peeking at me?
たく……言えば裸くらい見せてやるのによ。まぁアレだろ？　覗いてるって興奮がいいんだろ？　この変態め。=If you'd told me, I'd have let you see me naked. That's the thing, right? You like the excitement of being watched, don't you? You pervert.
