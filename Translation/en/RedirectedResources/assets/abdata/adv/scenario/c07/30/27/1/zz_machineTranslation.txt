待て、オレはイってねぇぞ？　こういうのは、お互い気持ちよくなんねぇとダメだろうが。=Wait, I didn't cum, did I? This kind of thing is only good if it makes both of us feel good.
おい、自分だけイって終わりか？　あんまりオレを失望させるなよ？=What, you're just gonna let yourself go? Don't disappoint me too much, okay?
まぁ、上手くイケない時もあるか。おい、次までにはもっと上手くなっておけよ？=Well, sometimes you can't get it right. Hey, you better be good by next time, okay?
オマエがイケただけで良しとするか。ここであーだこーだ言っても、みっともねぇだけだしな。=I guess it's good that you were able to do it. You can't just sit here and talk about it.
次はオレもイカせろよ？　一人だけイって満足なんてのは、そう何回も許されねぇからな？=Next time, let me cum too, okay? You can't be satisfied with only one person cumming so many times, you know?
ハッ、やっぱオレには敵わねぇってことだろ。でも努力はしろよ？　力づくでオレを落とすくらいのことはしてみろ。=You're no match for me after all. But you have to try, right? You should at least try to beat me by force.
オレの勝ちってことでいいな？　イケなかったのは不満だが、好き放題にしてやったって感じは嫌いじゃねぇ。=I guess that means I won, right? I'm not happy that I didn't get it, but I don't mind the feeling that I got to do whatever I wanted.
おいおい、もう少し骨のあるやつだと思ったんだけどな。オレの見込み違いってやつか？=I thought you'd be a little more bony. Am I wrong about that?
ちょっと待て、流石にこれで終わりは許されねぇぞ？　オマエがぶっ壊れようが、オレには知ったことじゃねぇしな。=Wait a minute, I can't let this be the end. I don't care if you're broken or not.
ハッ、一人だけイって、ハイさよらか？　クズらしい終わり方だな。お似合いだ。=Huh, only one of you came, and you're high? That's a scummy ending. It suits you.
おかげさまで、オマエのことがもっと嫌いになれそうだ。おい、これはそういう狙いなんだろう？=Thanks to you, I'm going to hate you even more. Hey, that's what this is all about, isn't it?
いいか、自己満足で終わりたいってんなら、一人でオナニーでもしてろ。最初からオレを巻き込むな。=Look, if you want to end up with your own self-gratification, go masturbate by yourself. Don't drag me into it from the start.
ほう、とことん焦らすってわけか。ハッ、おもしれぇ。上等だよ。=Oh, so you're going to rush me every step of the way. Ha, that's fun. It's good.
おい、これで終わりか？　自分だけイケれば満足ってか？　なんだ、オマエもゴミクズだったのか。=Hey, is that all you got? You're satisfied if you're the only one who can get it? What, you're a piece of trash, too?
まさか、オマエがその程度のやつだったとはな。オレが好きにしていいって言ったのは、こういう意味じゃねぇぞ？=I didn't think you were that kind of person. This is not what I meant when I said you can do whatever you want.
こういう冗談はあんまり好きじゃねぇ。ヤり直すなら、早めにしておけ？=I don't really like this kind of joke. If you're going to get laid again, do it sooner rather than later.
オマエの目は節穴か？　まさか、オレがイってないことに気付いてないのか？=Are your eyes blind? You don't even know I'm not coming, do you?
ほう、オレを試すとは、いい度胸じゃねぇか。いつ襲われてもいいように、身体は綺麗にしとけよ。=You've got a lot of nerve testing me, don't you? You should keep your body clean so that you can be attacked at any time.
