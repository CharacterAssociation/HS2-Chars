普通{0}=Normal {0}
よう、はじめましてだな。=Hey, it's nice to meet you.
あ？　なんだオマエ、もう大きくしてんのか？　まったく、男ってのは単純だな。で、ちゃんとそれは、使い物になるんだろうな？=What? What, you're already big? Man, men are so simple. And you're sure it's going to work?
ほう、オマエがオレの相手か？　まぁ、よろしく頼む。こういうのは男がリードするもんだろう？　ちゃんとオレを楽しませろよ？=Oh, so you're my partner, huh? Well, it's nice to meet you. It's the man who leads, right? Just make sure you entertain me, okay?
へぇ、オレを選ぶなんてどんなヤツかと思ったが、案外普通だな。=I was wondering what kind of guy would choose me, but he's more normal than I thought.
まぁ、そう気を悪くするな。これから色々するんだろ？　なら、まずは仲良くしねぇとな。=Well, don't feel so bad. You're going to do a lot of things, aren't you? Then we should get along first.
好意{0}=Favors {0}
オマエ、見た目はまぁまぁだな。一応合格ってことにしといてやる。=You're not that bad looking. I'll give you a pass.
で？　オレはどうだ？　正直に言っていいぞ。どうせガサツな女が来たとか思ってるんだろ？=So? What about me? You can be honest with me. You think I'm a crass bitch, don't you?
おう、オマエか？　オレを呼んだ酔狂なやつってのは……=Oh, is that you? The drunk who called me is...
分かってるだろうが、女らしさとかは期待すんなよ？　そんなもん期待してんなら、そもそもオレを呼ぶな。=You know that, but don't expect me to be feminine or anything. If you're expecting anything like that, don't call me in the first place.
ふぅん……まぁ、悪くはねぇかな。オレと目を合わせられるだけでも大したもんだ。=Hmmm... Well, that's not so bad. Just being able to make eye contact with me is a big deal.
こっちもそれなりに期待してるかんな？　男の意地ってやつを、見せてみろよ。=I'm expecting a lot from you, aren't I? Let's see what a man can do.
享楽より20～49{0}=20-49 from Kyouraku{0}
おっと、オマエだな？　オレを抱きたいなんて馬鹿言ってるやつは。=Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're the one who was foolish enough to want to hold me.
フッ、そういう無謀な野郎は嫌いじゃない。とりあえずオレを満足させてみろ、話はそこからだ。=I don't mind reckless bastards like that. Just try to satisfy me, and we'll talk about it.
ハッ、オレを呼ぶなんてどんなやつかと思ったら、別に大したことはなさそうだな。=Ha, I was wondering what kind of person would call me, but it doesn't seem like a big deal.
まぁ、こういうことに慣れる相手としちゃ悪くないかもな。=Well, maybe it's not a bad partner to get used to this kind of thing.
享楽より50～79{0}=50-79 from Kyouraku {0}
ほお、悪くない面構えだな。ギラついた目しやがって、女に飢えてるってとこか？=Oh, you're not bad-looking. What's with the glazed eyes and the hunger for women?
いいのか？　オレはちょっと食い辛い女だぞ？　腹壊しても知らねーかんな？=Are you sure? I'm a bit of a picky eater, you know? I don't care if you get a stomach ache, okay?
ったく、男臭い匂いさせやがって。ヤルことしか考えてない猿はこれだから困る。=Oh, man, you smell like a man. This is why monkeys who only think about getting laid are so annoying.
いいか？　最初だけでも、ちゃんと優しくしろよ？　こう見えて、オレも一応女だからな？=Okay? Just be nice to me at first, okay? I may look like a woman, but I'm a woman too, okay?
享楽より80～100{0}=80-100{0}
よし来たな。とりあえず話は一度ヤッてからだな。おい、まさか今更ビビってねえよな？=Okay, you're here. Let's talk about it after we've had sex. Hey, you're not freaking out now, are you?
オマエだって、そういう目的で来たんだろう？　なら腹くくれ。女のオレが覚悟決めてんだ。みっともない姿は見せんなよ？=That's what you came here for, isn't it? Then be prepared. I'm a woman, and I've made up my mind. I'm a woman, and I've made up my mind. Don't show me your disgusting appearance.
なぁオマエ、まさか童貞じゃねえよな？　いや、別にそれならそれで構わねえが……オレも上手い方じゃねぇから、痛くしても恨むなよ？=You're not a virgin, are you? No, I don't mind if you are, but I'm not very good at it either, so don't resent me if I hurt you.
嫌悪より20～49{0}=From disgust 20-49{0}
あ゛？　なんだオマエ……オレにガン付けてんのか？　今日の相手？　知るか馬鹿。ぶっ飛ばされねぇだけ、ありがたいと思えよ？=Aaah? What are you... Gunning for me? Today's opponent? Who cares? You should be grateful you didn't get blown up.
おいおい待てよ。まさか、オマエが相手とか言わねぇよなぁ？　勘弁してくれ……今日は厄日か？=Wait, wait, wait. You're not going to tell me that you're my partner, are you? Give me a break... Is today a bad day?
おい、疫病神様よ。オマエとヤったら、厄払いになんのか？=Hey, plague god. If I fuck you, will it get rid of the bad luck?
嫌悪より50～79{0}=50-79 from disgust {0}
ここに来れば、無条件にヤれるとか思ってたのか？　まったく、こっちの迷惑も考えろってんだ……=Did you think you could just come in here and get laid without any strings attached? Oh, for God's sake, think of the trouble we're in...
オマエ、ゴミみたいな匂いがプンプンしてるぜ。そんなんで相手しろとか、フザけ過ぎだな。=You're smelling like garbage. You're too much of a jerk to take me on like that.
いいか？　身体くらい綺麗にしとけ。こういう所に来る前の、最低限の礼儀だろ？=You know what? You should at least clean yourself up. It's the least you can do before you come here, right?
嫌悪より80～100{0}=80-100{0} than disgust.
おいおいおいおい、なんでゴミ虫がこんなとこまで入ってきてんだ？　オマエ、どこまで身の程知らずなんだ？=Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you trash bugs coming in here? How far do you think you've got to go?
おいゴミクズ。オマエだ、オマエのこと言ってんだよ。返事もろくに出来ねぇのか？　ったく。オレは害虫の躾に来たんじゃねぇぞ？=Hey, piece of trash. It's you. I'm talking about you. Can't you even answer me? Damn it. I'm not here to discipline vermin, okay?
まぁ、ゴミクズでも上手けりゃ文句はねぇ。で、そこんとこオマエはどうなんだ？=Well, I don't have a problem with trash as long as it's good. So, what about you?
隷属より20～49{0}=From slavery 20-49{0}
おら、ちゃんとこっち見ろ。これからヤる相手だぞ？　礼儀ってもんがあんだろ？=Hey, look at me. You're about to fuck someone. You have to be polite.
ったく。男のくせにナヨナヨしてんじゃねーぞ？　もっと、オレを押し倒すくらいの勢いで来い。=Oh, man. Don't be a pussy for a guy. Come on, you've got to push me down.
おい、分かってんな？　オマエの役目は、オレを気持ちよくすることだ。そのためなら、多少の無茶は許してやる。=Hey, you know what? Your job is to make me feel good. I'll forgive a little recklessness if that's what it takes.
いいか？　ビビんねぇで最後までちゃんとしろよ？=You know what? Don't be afraid to finish the job, okay?
隷属より50～79{0}=50-79{0} from servitude.
うん、まぁまぁなのが来たな。オマエにリードは任せてやる、ちゃんとやれよ？=Yeah, it's a decent one. I'll let you take the lead. You'll do fine, right?
オレは優しくしてくれなんて女々しいことは言わねぇ。女としちゃアレだが、めんどくさくなくていいだろ？=I'm not going to be a pussy and ask you to be nice to me. I don't want to be a pussy about being nice to you. I'm not a woman, but I don't want to be a pain in my ass.
おう、オマエがオレの相手か。よろしく頼む。正直、こういうのはよく分かんねぇから任せる。=Oh, so you're my opponent. I'm looking forward to working with you. To be honest, I don't know much about this kind of thing, so I'll leave it to you.
男が女を気持ちよくするのは当然だろ？　退屈だけはさせんじゃねーぞ？=A man is supposed to make a woman feel good, right? Don't let me bore you, okay?
隷属より80～100{0}=80-100{0} from servitude.
ふぅん。おいオマエ、わりと経験はある方か？　自慢じゃねーが、オレは微妙だ。だから任せる。=Hmm. Hey, you're rather experienced, aren't you? I'm not proud of it, but I'm not very experienced. So I'll leave it to you.
男ならしっかり決めてみせろ。最悪経験がなくても、気合で頑張れ。分かったな？=If you're a man, make a good decision. Even if you've never done it before, you've got to do it with guts. Do you understand?
ほぅ、いいじゃねーかこのドキドキ感。自分が女だって、少し思い出してきた。=Oh, isn't it nice, this thrill? I'm starting to remember that I'm a woman.
オレをどこまで女にできるかはオマエ次第だ。男なら、惚れさせてやるくらいの勢いで来いよ？=It's up to you to decide how much of a woman you can make of me. If you're a man, come with enough energy to make me fall in love with you.

依存{0}=Depends{0}
……へぇ、気に入った。ヤルぞ、今すぐだ。オレを待たせるなよ？　こう見えて気が短いんだ。=Oh, I like that. Let's do it. Now. Don't keep me waiting, okay? I've got a temper, you know?
うん、悪くないな。オマエを抱かせろ、拒否権は無い。=Yeah, that's not bad. Let me have you, you can't refuse.
