痛いのにも慣れてきたが、痛いだけってのは芸がねぇな。その辺りの加減を間違えるなよ？=I've gotten used to the pain, but it's not very artistic to just say it hurts. Don't make the mistake of taking it too far, okay?
そもそも、痛いと気持ちいいは本質的には似てるらしいな。まぁ、今ならそれも多少は分かる。=In the first place, I heard that pain and feeling good are essentially similar. Well, I can understand some of that now.
今日もオレを痛めつける気か？　ハッ、流石に慣れてきたからな……やられっぱなしにはならねぇ。=Are you going to hurt me again today? Ha, I'm getting used to it... I won't be left in the dust.
最近、苦痛にも耐性がついてきたな。どうも、オマエのせいでオレに変な癖がついちまったらしい。=I'm getting more tolerant of pain these days. It seems that I've developed a strange habit because of you.
痛いのも気持ちいいのも結局は刺激だ。そう深く考えることでもねぇが……分けて考える方が間違ってたみてぇだな。=Pain and pleasure are both stimuli in the end. It's not something to think about too much, but... It seems that it was wrong to think about them separately.
よし、オマエ……オレを痛めつけてみろ。どうした？　得意だろ？　オレが慣れてきてるのに、オマエがビビッてちゃ意味ねぇぞ？=All right, you... Go ahead and hurt me. What's up? You're good at that, right? What good is it if you're scared when I'm getting used to it?
おいクズ。どうせ、乱暴にしかできないんだろう？　オマエがそんなんだから、オレが慣れちまったじゃねぇか。=Hey, bum. You can only do it roughly anyway, can't you? I've gotten used to it because you're like that.
オマエに期待する方が間違ってると分かったからな、少し考え方を変えた。痛かろうが気持ち悪かろうが、なんでも来いだ。=I realized that I was wrong to expect anything from you, so I changed my mind a little. I don't care if it hurts, if it's uncomfortable, whatever.
案外オレ達は、相性がいいのかもしれねぇな。このオレがマゾに目覚めるとは、正直予想外だったが。=Maybe we're a better match than I thought. To be honest, I didn't expect that I would become a masochist.
オレは元々、ガツガツされるのは嫌いじゃない。少しくらい乱暴にされた方が、求められてるって気になるだろ？=I don't like to be pushy. I don't like to be pushy, but I do like to be a little rough, because it makes me feel wanted.
