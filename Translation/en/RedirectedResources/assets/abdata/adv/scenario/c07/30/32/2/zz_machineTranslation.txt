ん？　まさかオマエ……オレが寝てる間ずっと待ってたのか？　ハッ、律儀なやつだな。で、オレに何か用か？=Hmm? You... You've been waiting for me while I slept, haven't you? You're a very polite man, aren't you? So, what do you want from me?
おっと、暇人を大分待たせちまったみたいだな。お詫びに、オマエの好きなことをしてやるよ。=Oops, looks like I've kept you busy. As an apology, I'll do whatever you like.
おいおい、こんな所で待ってるくらいなら。夜這いの一つでもやってみろ。オレは噛み付いたりしねぇぞ？　むしろ歓迎してやる。=Oh, come on, I'd rather wait here. Why don't you go crawl in the night or something? I'm not going to bite you. In fact, I'd welcome it.
あ？　オマエ、ここでなにしてた？　不審者として通報されたくなかったら、さっさと消えろ。=Huh? What the hell are you doing here? If you don't want to be reported as a prowler, get the hell out of here.
ほう、心がけは立派だが、少し攻めの姿勢が足りねぇんじゃねぇか？　時にはガツンと、攻め込んでみるのも手だぜ？=You're doing a great job, but you're not being aggressive enough, are you? Sometimes it's a good idea to go in with a bang, you know?
