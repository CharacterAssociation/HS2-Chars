チッ、なんて時に入ってきやがる……オマエ、絶対覗いてたな？　分かってて入ってきただろう？=What a time to come in... You were definitely peeping at me, weren't you? You knew I was coming in, didn't you?
オマエ……どこから見てた？　偶然入ってきたってことはないよな？　正直に言ってみろ。=You... Where were you watching from? You didn't just walk in here by accident, did you? Be honest with me.
あ？　最悪なタイミングで入ってきやがったな……いや、これは逆に最高なのか？　こういうことは、二人の方が捗るからな。=Oh? You came in at the worst possible time... Or is this the opposite of the best? Because these things progress better when there's two of us.
クソが……少しは空気を読め。こういう時は、覗く程度で終わりにしておくもんだろうが。=Damn it... Read the air a little. In a situation like this, you're supposed to just take a peek and be done with it.
はぁ……オマエだって一人ですることくらいあるだろう？　オレだって同じだ。そこにたまたま、オマエが来ちまっただけさ。=Huh... You do things alone, don't you? It's the same for me. It's just that you just happened to be there.
