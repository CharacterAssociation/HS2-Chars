おう、また会ったな。なんだ、オレのことが気に入っちまったのか？　まぁ、悪い気はしねぇがな。=Oh, we meet again. What, do you like me now? Well, I don't feel bad about it.
オマエも懲りねぇな。自分で言うのもなんだが、オレを何回も呼ぶってのは、相当変わりもんなんじゃねぇか？=You never learn, do you? I can't believe I'm saying this, but if you keep calling me, you must be pretty strange, huh?
好意より20～49{0}=20-49{0} from favor
よう、またオマエか。なんだ、オレは好かれてんのか？　まったく、妙なやつに懐かれちまったな。=Hey, it's you again. What, do they like me? I've got a strange one that's taken a liking to me.
よし、もう挨拶とかは必要ねぇだろ。ハッ、顔見知りだと、色々面倒なことが省けて助かるな。=Okay, I guess we don't need to say hello anymore. Ha, it's nice to know each other, it saves a lot of trouble.
好意より50～79{0}=50-79{0} from favor.
ほう、どうやらオマエは、オレのことが忘れられなかったようだな？　ハッ、なかなか悪くない気分だ。=Well, it looks like you couldn't get me out of your mind, huh? Ha, not a bad feeling.
喜べ、オレもオマエとまたシたいと思ってた。てわけで……前置きはもういらねぇな？　さっさと来い。=Rejoice, I've been wanting to have sex with you again too. So... No more preamble, huh? Just come on.
好意より80～100{0}=80-100{0} over favoritism
へぇ、こういう時は、光栄とか言っておけばいいのか？　安心しろ、オレを選んだこと、後悔はさせねぇよ。=Oh, so I should just say I'm honored? Don't worry, you won't regret your choice of me.
なんだろうな……オマエと会うと、妙に体が火照りやがる。おい、早く鎮めろ。それがオマエの役目だろ？=I don't know... When I see you, my body feels strangely on fire. Hey, hurry up and calm it down. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
享楽より20～49{0}=20-49 from Kyouraku{0}
なんだ、オマエもここでするのにハマったくちか？　まぁ、気持ちは分からなくもない。オレも同じだしな。=What, you're into doing it here, too? Well, I don't know how you feel. It's the same for me.
ようやくお出ましか。ほら、さっさとするぞ？　初対面ってわけじゃねぇんだ。余計な挨拶は省略だ、省略。=Finally, you're here. Let's get on with it, shall we? It's not like we're meeting for the first time. Skip the unnecessary greetings, skip it.
享楽より50～79{0}=50-79 from Kyouraku {0}
なぁ、気付いてるか？　オレの匂いだ……実はもう、少し濡れてる。オマエだって、どうせ同じようなもんだろ？=Hey, you notice that? I smell... Actually, I'm already a little wet. You're the same way, aren't you?
フッ、オレに会いに来たってことは、ヤルことは一つだな？　よし、早速始めるか。=Well, if you've come to see me, then you've come to do one thing, right? Okay, let's get started.
享楽より80～100{0}=80-100{0}
さて、今日はどうするか。フッ、やりたいことが多過ぎるのも、困りもんだな。=So, what should I do today? There's no such thing as too many things to do.
おいおい、発情した匂いさせやがって……そんなんじゃ、オレに襲われても文句は言えねーぞ？=Hey, you smell like you're in heat... You can't complain if I attack you like that, can you?
嫌悪より20～49{0}=From disgust 20-49{0}
オマエ、全然凝りてねぇな？　あんだけ言われて、またオレを呼ぶなんて……アレか？　マゾってやつか？=You're not very sophisticated at all, are you? After all that, you call me again... Is that it? Are you a masochist?
相変わらず、見ただけで殴りたくなる顔だな。ほら、さっさと始めねぇと、本気で顔が変形することになるぞ？=As usual, your face makes me want to punch you just by looking at it. Come on, get started or you're going to seriously deform your face, okay?
嫌悪より50～79{0}=50-79 from disgust {0}
オマエは馬鹿なのか？　それともただのクソマゾか？　まぁ、どっちでもいい……ヤルことは結局変わんねぇしな。=Are you an idiot? Or are you just a fucking masochist? Well, it doesn't matter... What we do is the same after all.
ほう、まさかオマエ、オレを試してるのか？　どんだけ汚い言葉で詰れるかって、これはそういう試験なんだろ？=Oh, you're testing me, aren't you? This is a test to see how many swear words you can use, right?
嫌悪より80～100{0}=80-100{0} than disgust.
おいゴミムシ。オマエの種族にはメスはいねぇのか？　それとも、ただオマエが壊滅的にモテないだけか？=Hey, garbage beetle. Do you have any females in your species? Or are you just devastatingly unattractive?
まったく、迷惑なやつに懐かれちまったな。可愛気のかけらもねぇが、サンドバックには丁度いいか……=I've been pining for this annoying guy. There's nothing cute about him, but he's a good sandbag...
隷属より20～49{0}=From slavery 20-49{0}
よく来たな。ハッ、らしくねぇが……オマエとできると思ったら、妙に身体が火照りやがる。=I'm glad you're here. It's not like me, but my body feels strangely lit up at the thought of being with you.
よう、オレの身体が忘れられなかったか？　なら、好きなだけ触ってけばいい。歓迎してやるぞ。=Hey, you can't get over my body, can you? Then go ahead and touch me all you want. You're welcome to it.
隷属より50～79{0}=50-79{0} from servitude.
やっと来たか。オレを待たせるとは、いい度胸だ。おかげで、もう濡れてきちまってるじゃねぇか。=You're finally here. You had the nerve to make me wait. Thanks to you, I'm already starting to get wet.
おい、ちゃんと練習してきたか？　前と同じじゃ、オレは満足させられねぇぞ？=Hey, have you been practicing? You can't satisfy me the same way you did before.
隷属より80～100{0}=80-100{0} from servitude.
もう分かってると思うが、オレは別に乱暴にされても文句は言わねぇ。ただ、痛いだけってのも芸がねぇぞ？=As you probably know by now, I don't complain when people rough me up. I'm not going to complain about it.
良かったな。オレくらい何でも許すやつはそういねぇぞ？　オマエのやりたいこと、全部試してみりゃいい。=Good for you. There aren't many people who can forgive anything as much as I can. You should try everything you want to do.
