話しだけってのも、まぁまぁ楽しめたな。=I enjoyed the idea of just talking about it, I guess.
退屈はしなかったな。また話してやってもいい。=I wasn't bored, was I? We can talk again.
もうこんな時間か。つい話し込んじまったな。=Is it that time already? I must have gotten carried away.
よし、そろそろ切り上げるか。話の続きはまた今度だ。=Okay, I'd better get going. I'll tell you the rest of the story another time.
話してるだけでも、結構時間が経つもんだな。それなりに楽しかったぞ。=We spent a lot of time just talking, didn't we? It was fun in its own way.
オレと話せて嬉しかったろ？　興奮したか？=You were happy to talk to me, weren't you? Are you excited?
やっと終わったか。無駄に長いだけで、どうでもいい話だったな。=It's finally over. It was just a long, useless, and unimportant story.
あぁ、時間を無駄にした。くだらねぇ話ばっかしやがって。=Oh, I've wasted my time. All we did was talk about stupid shit.
さて、この辺で終わりにしとかねぇとな。ずっと話し込んじまいそうだ。=Well, I'd better get this over with. I feel like I'm going to be talking forever.
オマエと話すのも悪くないな。次もオレを退屈させるなよ？=It's not bad to talk to you. Next time, don't bore me, okay?
