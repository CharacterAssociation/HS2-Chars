享楽{0}=Enjoyment {0}
いいね。大分オレ好みの部屋だ。形から入るのは全然悪くねぇ……=It's nice. This room is much to my liking. It's not bad to start from scratch...
んで、どうせオマエはオレに苛められたいんだろう？=And you want to be tormented by me anyway, don't you?
まさかオレを苛めたいなんて生意気なことは……言わねぇよなぁ？=You wouldn't be so cocky as to want to torment me, would you?
大層な部屋だな。こんだけ揃ってれば何でもできそうだ……=It's a big room. With all this stuff, you could do anything...
オマエを拘束して、オレ好みに調教してやるよ。=I'm going to restrain you and train you to my liking.
そういうことを期待して、この部屋につれて来たんだろ？　なぁ？=That's what you brought me into this room for, isn't it? Didn't you?
なんだ苛めて欲しかったのか。いいぞ、望み通りにしてやる。=What, you wanted me to torment you? All right, I'll give you what you want.
ここなら防音もしっかりしてそうだからな、泣き喚いても大丈夫だぞ。=I'm sure this place will be soundproofed, so you won't have to worry about crying your eyes out.
まずは拘束するか……逃げられたりすると面倒だからな。=We'll have to restrain him first... It'll be troublesome if he escapes.
