酒の勢いってのは感心しねぇが。まぁ、何もできないよりはマシか。=I'm not impressed with the momentum of alcohol, though. Well, it's better than not being able to do anything.
オレを酔わせてどうする気だ？　まさか、オマエに酔えなんて、キザったらしいことを言うつもりじゃねぇだろうな？=What are you trying to do, get me drunk? You're not going to tell me to get you drunk, are you?
酒と女とセックスってか？　よく馬鹿の代表みたいに語られる話だが、別に間違っちゃいねぇ。本質ってのは、案外そういうもんだ。=Drinking, women, and sex? It's often talked about as if it were representative of stupidity, but it's not wrong. That's what the true nature of things is.
情けねぇ。酒の勢いでも借りねぇと女も抱けねぇってことだろ？　悔しかったら、今すぐオレを襲ってみろよ。=It's pathetic. You can't even hold a woman without the help of alcohol, right? If you're frustrated, go ahead and attack me right now.
いいねぇ、オレにも酒にも、たっぷりと溺れるといい。オマエが酒の勢いで何をしようが、文句は言わねぇからよ。=It's a good idea to drown yourself in me and in alcohol. I'm not going to complain about what you do when you're drunk.
