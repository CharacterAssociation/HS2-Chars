そうか、オレには縁の薄い話だな。=Well, that's not really my thing, is it?
まぁ、分からなくもねぇが……=Well, I don't know, but...
そんなもんだろ？　深く考える程のことでもねぇよ。=That's how it is, right? It's not something to think about too much.
まー、人それぞれだな。オレにはよく分からん。=Well, I guess it depends on the person. I'm not sure.
なぁ……この話、楽しいか？=Hey... Are you enjoying this story?
……そういうこともある。いちいち気にしてたらキリがねぇ。=... There are times like that. There's no end to it if you pay attention to every little thing.
ったく、オマエには一番似合わねぇ話だな。=Well, that's the worst kind of story for you.
……オマエの話はしつこいんだよ。もっと要領よく話せ。=... You're talking too much. Speak more to the point.
……で？　この話はいつまで続くんだ？=... So? How long is this story going to last?
理屈じゃねぇことを考えても、埒が明かねぇだろ。=Thinking about things that aren't logical won't get us anywhere.
