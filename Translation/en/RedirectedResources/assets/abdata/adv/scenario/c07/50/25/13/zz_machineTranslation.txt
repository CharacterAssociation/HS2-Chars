なんだここは……あの気色悪いのは生きてるのか？　信じられないな……=What the hell is this place... That freaky thing is still alive? I can't believe it...
待て。オマエにされるならまだしも……まさかバケモノの相手をしろなんて言わないよな？=Wait. If you're going to do this to me, you're not going to ask me to deal with a monster, are you?
こんな生き物……オマエが好きそうなエロマンガだけのものだと思ってたが、まさか本当にいるとはな……=I thought creatures like this were only found in erotic manga that you liked, but I never thought they really existed...
気持ち悪い者同士、オマエと触手で遊んでくればいいだろう？　俺を巻き込むな……=Why don't you two creeps just go play tentacle with each other? Don't drag me into this...
おい、オレをアイツらの餌にする気か？　流石に食われるのは勘弁だぞ？=Hey, are you trying to feed me to them? You don't want to get eaten, do you?
