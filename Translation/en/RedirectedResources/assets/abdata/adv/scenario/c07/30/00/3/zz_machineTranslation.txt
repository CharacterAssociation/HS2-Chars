ん？　なんだそれは……オレを馬鹿にしてんのか？=Hmm? What is that... Are you mocking me?
何を遠慮してんだ？　よく分かんねぇやつだな。=What are you waiting for? I don't know what you're talking about.
オレをおちょくりに来たのか？　あんま舐めてると、オマエでもぶっ飛ばすぞ？=Did you just come to mess with me? If you don't take me seriously, I'll kick my ass.
なんだかよくわからねーが。何でもねぇって言うなら、もうお開きだな。=I don't know what it is, but... If you say it's nothing, then I guess we're done here.
なんだ？　用が無いなら、最初からオレに構うな。=What is it? If you don't want me, don't bother with me in the first place.
思わせぶりな態度をしてるつもりか？　オレには何にも伝わってねぇぞ？=You think you're being disingenuous? I'm not getting anything from you, okay?
あ？　とことん意味不明なやつだな。用が無いなら、オレの視界に入ってくんな。=Oh? I don't know what the hell you're talking about. If you don't have any business with me, stay out of my sight.
クソが。オマエはオレをイラつかせるのが本当に上手いな。=Damn it. You're really good at pissing me off, you know that?
ほう、オレは試されてるのか？　なぁ、どうなんだ？=Oh, so I'm being tested, huh? Well, what do you think?
つまり、オレから誘われるのを期待してるのか？　そんな受け身なやつには、かける言葉はねぇな。=So you're expecting me to ask you out? I have nothing to say to such a passive person.
