待て、急にヤボ用ができた。少し寄り道するが、いちいち詮索するなよ？=Wait, I've suddenly got some business to attend to. I'm going to take a little detour, but don't pry into my business, okay?
ん……少し寄りたいところが出来た。オマエはここで待ってろ。ついてくんじゃねぇぞ？=I've got a little place to stop. You wait here. Don't follow me, okay?
あー、あれだ……トイレに行きてぇ。少し待たせるが、気にすんな。=Uh, that's it, I have to go to the bathroom. I'll keep you waiting a bit, but don't worry about it.
おい、トイレに寄ってく。間違っても、覗きなんか来るんじゃねぇぞ？=Hey, I'm going by the bathroom. Don't make the mistake of peeking in here, okay?
あー、生理現象ってやつだ。ここまで言えば分かるな？　オレについてくんなよ？=Uh, it's a physiological phenomenon. You know what I'm saying? You're not following me, are you?
