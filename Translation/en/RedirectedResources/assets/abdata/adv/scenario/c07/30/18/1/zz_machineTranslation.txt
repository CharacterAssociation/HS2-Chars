よし、よく来た。とりあえずこれを解け。ちゃんとご褒美はやるから、変な気起こすなよ？=Okay, you're here. Untie this for now. I'll give you a good reward, so don't freak out, okay?
一つ言い忘れたことがある。助ける時にだ……オレの身体をあまり強く掴んだりするな。いいな？　オレは忠告したぞ？=There's one thing I forgot to tell you. When you help me, don't grab me too hard. Okay? I warned you, didn't I?
おっと、ようやくお出ましか。色々試してみたが、この縄は一人じゃ解けねぇ。助けてくれたら、それなりの礼はするぜ？=Oh, there you are, finally. I've tried everything, but I can't untie this rope by myself. If you help me, I'll pay you back in kind, okay?
そうだ、一つだけ忠告しておく。オレの下半身をあまり弄るな。オレもひどいことになるが、オマエはそれ以上にやばいことになるぞ？=Yeah, I'll give you one piece of advice. Don't play with my lower body too much. I'll get in trouble, but you'll get in even worse trouble.
おい、余計なことは考えるなよ？　オマエはただ、オレの縄を解くことだけ考えてろ。=Hey, don't think about anything else, okay? All you have to do is think about untying me.
いいか？　オレの下腹部には絶対に触るな。どうなっても知らねぇぞ？=All right? Don't ever touch my lower abdomen. I don't care what happens, okay?
どうだ？　そそる格好だろう？　でもまぁ、まずは助けろ。その後でなら、いくらでも付き合ってやるから。=What do you think? Intriguing outfit, isn't it? But first, help me. After that, I'll go out with you as much as you want.
なんとなく分かってるとは思うが……オレは今、色々と限界だ。オマエがそういう趣味なら止めないが、冷静に考えろよ？=I know you're aware of this, but I'm at my wits' end. I'm not going to stop you if that's what you're into, but just think about it, okay?
