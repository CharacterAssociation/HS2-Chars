……へ？　何、してんの……？　てか、ええっ！？　こ、これって、よ、よ、よ、夜這い……だよね？=... Huh? What, are you doing? I mean, what? This is, yo, yo, yo, night crawling... Right?
もう、寝込みを襲うとか……ちゃんと言ってくれればOKしたのに……でもお前はこれがいいんだもんね。=I'd have said yes if you'd have told me that you were going to attack me in my sleep or something... But you're good with this, aren't you?
あはは、たまにはこういうのもいいよねぇ♪=Haha, it's good to have something like this once in a while ♪
サイッテー！　常識が無いとは思ってたけど、これ程とは思わなかった！=Saitte! I knew you didn't have common sense, but I didn't think you had it in you!
