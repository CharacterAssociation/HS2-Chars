あー、お風呂でスるなら、お互いのぼせないようにしないとね……ほら、結構動くし……それに、途中で止めるとか、多分できないでしょ？=Oh, if we're going to have a bath, we'll have to make sure we don't overheat each other... You know, we move around a lot... And we probably can't stop in the middle of a bath, can we?
お前とお風呂に入るのがこんな形でなんて……い、嫌ってわけじゃないけど、ほら、もう少し情緒がほしいじゃん、旅行とか、マイホームのとか。=It's not that I don't want to take a bath with you, but I'd like a little more emotion, you know, like a trip or my home.
って、私何言ってるんだろ、べ、別にいいじゃんね？　これからふたりでスるんだもん……ね。=I don't know what I'm saying, but it doesn't matter, does it? We're going to have sex together... Right?
お～、セックスするのが贅沢に感じるぐらい大きなお風呂だねぇ♪=Oh, it's such a big bath that having sex feels like a luxury ♪
だからってゆっくり語らい合う？　って聞かれたら身体と快楽で語り明かそう！　って感じだけど♪=But if you're asking me if I'd like to spend time with you, I'll tell you what. If you're asking me if I'd like to spend time with you, I'd say let's just talk about our bodies and our pleasures. I think so ♪
だって、お風呂は後からでも入れるけど、セックスは待ちきれないじゃん♪　私の中で温まってねぇ♪=You can take a bath later, but you can't wait to have sex... Warm yourself inside me ♪
何考えてるか知らないけど、のぼせて動けなくなるのがオチじゃない？=I don't know what you think you're doing, but you're going to get all hot and bothered, aren't you?
お風呂であったまりながらエッチとか……なんか、すっごく贅沢な感じするね。=Having sex while warming up in the bathtub... It's a very luxurious feeling, isn't it?
