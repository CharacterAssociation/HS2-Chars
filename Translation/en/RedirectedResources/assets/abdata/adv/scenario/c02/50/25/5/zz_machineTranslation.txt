まぁ、こういう場所のお風呂ですから……するのは当然、って事ですね……=Well, it's a bath in a place like this, so I guess it's only natural...
夫婦なら、ここで「お背中流しますね」となるんでしょうね。　……私達も、いつか……=If we were a couple, this is where we would probably say, "I'll wash your back... We, too, someday...
お風呂でなら汚し放題、という事ですか？　なら、好きなだけ汚させてもらいますかね。=Are you saying that I can get as dirty as I want in the bathroom? If that's the case, I guess I can get as dirty as I want.
ここでなら事後処理も楽なのが救いですね。=It helps that the post-processing is so much easier here.
お風呂だと熱が篭りますね。　……身体の熱も篭りそうです。=In the bath, heat is trapped... It seems to trap the heat of the body as well.
