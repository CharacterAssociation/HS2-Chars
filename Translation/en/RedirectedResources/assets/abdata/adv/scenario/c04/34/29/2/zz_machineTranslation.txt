あれ……アンタもお風呂？　んふふっ、もしや……アタシを追いかけてきたとか？=Are you taking a bath, too? Hmmm... Are you following me?
うわ、いたんなら言ってよ。アンタとなら、一緒に入ってあげても良かったのに♪=Ugh, tell me you were there. I could've come in with you ♪
へぇ、こんなところで偶然じゃん！　なんて……どうせ覗いてたんしょぉ？　正直に言ってみなー？=Well, what a coincidence! You were just peeking, weren't you? Why don't you tell me the truth?
あーいたんだ。存在感薄くて気付かなかった。=Oh, there you are. I didn't notice it because it was so thin.
ありゃ、そんなとこにいたんだ。うーん、丁度綺麗にしてきたとこだから……今はちょっと汗かきたくないかも……=Ahhh, there you are. Well, I just got cleaned up, so... Maybe I don't want to sweat a bit right now...
