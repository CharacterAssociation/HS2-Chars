うぇっ！？　ちょっとアンタ！　馬鹿なんじゃないのっ！　てか、バレてるのに堂々と見るなし！　さっさと出てって！=What the hell? Hey, you! You're such an idiot! And don't look at me when you know I'm here! Get the hell out of here!
ひゃう！？　はぁービビったぁ……アンタじゃなかったら、熱湯ぶっかけてたわ。で？　いつまでそこにいる気なん？=Ahhh! If it wasn't for you, I would've thrown boiling water on you. So? How long are you going to stay there?
ねぇ、ひょっとしてバレてないとか思ってる？　アンタがどーすんのかなーって、こっちは結構期待してたんだけど。はぁ……流石に待ちくたびれた。=Hey, do you think they don't know? I was wondering what you were going to do, and I was pretty excited about it. I'm so tired of waiting.
ちょお！　マジ死ねし！　何考えてんの！　３秒以内に出てかなかったら通報！　アタシ本気だかんね！=Whoa! You're gonna die! What the hell were you thinking? If you're not out of here in three seconds, I'm calling the cops! I'm serious!
あぇっ！？　あーまぁガン無視されるよりはいいけど。えっと、一緒に入る？　折角来たんだから、ゆっくりしてきなよ。=Aah! Oh, well, it's better than being ignored. Do you want to come in with me? Since you've come all this way, why don't you take your time?
ちょい待ち。アンタ、今覗いてたっしょ？　タダでは帰らせないよ～。ちゃんとお代は頂くから♪=Wait a minute. You were just peeking, weren't you? I won't let you leave for free! You will pay for it ♪
