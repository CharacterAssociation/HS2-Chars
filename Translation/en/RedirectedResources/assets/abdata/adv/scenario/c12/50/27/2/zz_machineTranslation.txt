もう終わりでいいのか？　お前がそういうなら別にいいけどさ……=Are you sure you want to do this? If that's what you want to call it, fine, but...
俺だけいっちゃったみたいだけど……お前はこれで良かったのか？=It looks like I'm the only one who's gone... But you're okay with this?
俺をいかせたかったのかよ？　エッチな奴だな。=You wanted to make me cum, didn't you? You're a naughty boy.
俺だけしかいってないのに……お前が満足ならそれでいいけど。=I'm the only one who said that, but... If you're happy, that's fine.
気持ち良かったよ。次は絶対一緒にいこうな。=It felt good. Next time, let's go together for sure.
お前に感じさせられて……思いっきりいっちゃったよ。=You made me feel so good that I went all the way.
俺はとにかく大満足だったよ！　お前は、いかなくても良かったのか？=I was very happy anyway! You didn't have to go, did you?
なんか悪かったな、俺ばっか感じちゃって……でも、気持ち良かったぜ、本当に。=I'm sorry, I'm the one who felt it... But it felt good, really good.
思いっきりいかされちゃったなぁ。最高に気持ち良かったぜ。=I was made to cum as hard as I could. It was the best feeling ever.
お前にいかされて終わりなんて、なんか落ち込みそうだよ。=I'm going to be so depressed that you're going to make me cum and that's it.
終わりでいいんだろ。もうこれで十分だよ。=It's over, right? That's enough.
俺だけいったみたいだな……お前がそういうの好きなら、別にいいけど。=I guess I was the only one... If you like that kind of thing, I don't mind.
俺だけしかいってないけど、本当にいいのか？=I know I'm the only one who said it, but are you sure?
責めるだけで良かったのか？　お前はいけなかったじゃないか。=All you had to do was punish me? You shouldn't have done that.
俺を責めて満足したんだな？　だったら、なんの問題もないけど。=You've had your fill of punishing me, haven't you? Then I don't have any problem with it.
どうして俺だけなんだ？　お前に感じてもらえないなら、俺だって寂しい。=Why is it just me? If you can't feel it, I'll miss you too.
お前は今ので満足なのか？　お前が喜ぶなら、何をしてもいいんだからな。=Are you happy now? I don't care what you do, as long as it makes you happy.
お前はまだいってないじゃないか？　まさか、俺の身体に何か問題でもあったのか……=You haven't said anything yet, have you? Don't tell me there's something wrong with me...
