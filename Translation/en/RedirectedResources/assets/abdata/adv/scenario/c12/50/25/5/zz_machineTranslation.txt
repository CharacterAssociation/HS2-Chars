一緒に風呂に入るのって、なんだかドキドキするな……=It's kind of exciting to take a bath together...
汗も精液も、ここならすぐに流せるし、一石二鳥だな！=Sweat and semen can be washed right off here, two birds with one stone!
風呂だったら……一人でゆっくり入りたかったなぁ。=If it had been a bath... I would have liked to take a relaxing bath alone.
元々、裸になる場所だからかな……結構興奮してきたぜ。=Maybe it's because it's a place where people get naked... I'm getting pretty excited.
