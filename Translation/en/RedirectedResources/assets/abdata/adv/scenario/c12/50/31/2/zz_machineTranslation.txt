悪い、待たせたな。……どうかしたのか？　息が上がってるけど？=Sorry, I kept you waiting. What's wrong with you? You're breathing a little hard.
お待たせ……悪いな、一人にしちまって。=Sorry to keep you waiting... Sorry to leave you alone.
待っててくれたのか、ありがとな。　覗いてたりは、してないのか？=You've been waiting for me. Thanks. You're not snooping around or anything, are you?
……お前、本当についてきてないよな？=... You're not really following me, are you?
トイレ、覗きに来なかったのか？　それとも俺が気が付かなかっただけか。=Didn't you come to take a peek in the bathroom? Or was I just oblivious?
