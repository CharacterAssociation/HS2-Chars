お前ってこういう感じのが好きなのか……まぁ、お前が喜ぶなら、付き合ってやってもいいけどな。=You like this kind of thing... Well, if it makes you happy, I'll go out with you.
うおぉ、すごいなこの部屋？！　完全に目的決まってるじゃん、お手柔らかに頼むぜ！=Ahhh, what is this room? I know exactly what I'm doing here, so please be gentle!
なんだよ、この部屋……分かりやすすぎて嫌なんだけど……お前ひとりで遊べよ。=What's with this room... It's too obvious and I don't like it... You should play by yourself.
