こんちはー。今日は２人っすよー。=Hello. It's just the two of us today.
なんすかなんすか～？　３Ｐ目的っすかー？=What is it? What is it? Is it for a threesome?
あー今３Ｐ想像したっすねー？　やー、私がなんすけどー。=You just imagined a threesome, didn't you? No, that was me.
会うのがわかってたならーあなたのことを話してたんすけどねー残念っすー。=If I had known we were going to meet, I would have told her about you.
むふふー、２人で何してたかわかるっすかー？=Mmmm... Do you know what we were doing together?
あなたの方から会話に入ってくるなんてー超ヤる気マンマンじゃないすか～。=You're the one who's going to initiate the conversation.
おしゃべりに夢中であなたに気付かなかったっすー。=I was so busy chatting that I didn't notice you.
２人でおしゃべりは一旦中止っすねー。=The two of us stopped chatting for a while.
もしかしてーセックスのお誘いすかー？　しかも３Ｐとかだったら最高なんすけど～。=Is it possible that you're asking me to have sex with you? And if it's a threesome, that would be great.
２人でしゃべってたのにーあなたが見えた瞬間濡れちゃったんすけど～。=We were just talking together, but the moment I saw you, I got wet.
