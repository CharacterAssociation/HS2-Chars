お風呂上りだからか、いつもより身体が温かくて……とても心地よかったです。=Maybe it was because I had just finished taking a bath, but my body was warmer than usual... And I felt very comfortable.
では、私はもう一度入って参ります。宜しければ、貴方もご一緒にいかかですか？=I'm going to go in again. If you don't mind, I'd like you to join me.
お風呂上がりの良い運動になりました、有難うございます。=It was a good exercise after the bath, thank you very much.
はぁ……もう一度入って参ります。=Huh... I'll come in again.
思う存分汚すことが出来たでしょうか？=Were you able to get as dirty as you wanted?
