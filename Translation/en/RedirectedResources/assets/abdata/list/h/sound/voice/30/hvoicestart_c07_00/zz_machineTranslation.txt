いいか？　一応オレも女だ。そこんとこ、忘れるんじゃねーぞ？=You know what? I'm a woman, too. Don't forget that, okay?
おい、ハァハァ言い過ぎだろ。どこまで飢えてんだ？=Hey, you're huffing and puffing too much. How hungry are you?
おい、あんま調子に乗るなよ？　分かってんな？=Hey, don't get carried away, all right? You know what I mean?
ちゃんと気持ちよくできんのか？　不安しかねぇぞ？=Will you be able to do it properly and comfortably? I don't know, man.
ん……オレは動けないからな……全部オマエ次第だぞ？=Well, I'm stuck here, so it's all up to you, okay?
オレが動けないからって、あまり調子に乗るなよ？=Don't get too carried away just because I can't move, okay?
待て……なんてタイミングでやめやがる。少しは空気を読め。=Wait... What a time to stop. You need to read the situation a little.
ようやくがっつき始めたか、火が点くのが遅いんだよ愚図。=You're finally starting to get excited. You're a slow learner, fool.
まだできるよな？　そう簡単にヘバるんじぇねぇぞ？=You can still do it, right? You're not going to slip up that easily, are you?
オレはまだし足りないんだ。最後まで付き合ってもうらぞ。=I'm not done with you yet. I want you to stay with me until the end.
変わった趣味だな……匂いとか、気にならないのか？=That's an unusual hobby... Don't you mind the smell or something?
ほう……オマエが汚いと思わないなら、別にいいが。=Well, if you don't think it's dirty, I don't mind.
さて、始めるとするか。まぁ、お互いお手柔らかにって感じか？=Well, let's get started. Well, I guess we'll just have to go easy on each other, huh?
嫌なことがあったら、ハッキリ言え。分かったな？=If you don't like something, say so. Do you understand?
オマエ……それ今、尻に入れてたもんだろうが……鬼畜め。=You... That's what you just put in my ass... You devil.
この匂い、なんとかならねぇのか？　青臭くて酷いぞ？=Can't you do something about that smell? It smells so foul.
今キスすると、オマエの味がするぞ？　自分大好きか？=If you kiss me now, I'm gonna taste you, okay? Do you love yourself?
ほら、もう準備万端だ……早く挿れちまえ……=Come on, I'm ready... Get it in...
とりあえず挿れてみろ。もう十分ほぐれてるはずだ……=Just stick it in for now. It should be loose enough by now...
んんっ、おい……中に出すなら、ちゃんと先に言えよ？=If you're going to put it in me, why don't you say so first?
自分のは流石に嫌だと思わねぇのか？　変わったやつだな。=Don't you think you'd like to have your own? You're a strange guy.
んっ、もう我慢できん……オレに任せろ。損はさせねぇ。=Hmm, I can't take it anymore... Leave it to me. I won't let you lose.
本当に大丈夫か？　痛いだけなんて御免だぞ？=Are you sure you're okay? I don't want any pain, okay?
はぁ、オマエの変態趣味に付き合わされるとはな……=Huh, I never thought I'd have to deal with your perverted hobby...
どヘタクソ。自分のことばっか考えてんじゃねぇぞ？=You're a bad ass. Don't you think about yourself all the time, man.
おい、ヘバってんじゃねぇぞ？　この根性無しめが。=Hey, don't you dare slouch. You gutless bastard.
ほら、続けるぞ。オマエに拒否権はねぇからな。=Here, let's continue. You don't have the right to refuse.
そうだ、オマエには便所がお似合いだ。よーく綺麗にしろよ？=That's right. You belong in the toilet. Clean it up good, okay?
ハッ、オレと舐め合おうってか？　面白い事を考えるな……=Ha, you want to lick me? That's a funny idea...
よし、やってみるか……途中で音を上げるなよ？=Okay, let's do this... And don't make a sound in the process, okay?
フッ、女同士なんだ……そんな緊張することはねぇさ……=Huh, we're women... There's nothing to be nervous about...
オマエの身体は柔らかそうでいいな……興奮してくる……=I love how soft your body is... It makes me so excited...
ほら、オレを攻めてみろ……感じるところは、分かるだろ？=Go ahead, attack me... You know the feeling.
オマエが感じるようにしてみろ……たぶんそれが正解だ……=Try to make it feel like you're feeling it... Maybe it's the right thing to do...
さぁ、始めちまうぞ……？　ちゃんと大きくしとけよ……=Let's get started, shall we? Make sure it's big enough...
フッ、緊張で縮むなよ？　オレが楽しめなくなるからな……=Don't get too nervous, okay? I won't be able to enjoy myself...
ちゃんとやれよ？　できなかったら押し潰すぞ……？=Do it right, okay? If you don't, I'll crush you...
顔に乗られたいなんて……オマエは本当にマゾだな……=You're a real masochist, wanting to be ridden on the face...
フッ、オマエがよがりまくる姿を……二人で見てやるよ……=Huh, I'm going to watch you cum... For both of us...
贅沢言った分、オレ等をちゃんと楽しませろよ……？=You know, for being so extravagant, why don't you just let us enjoy ourselves?
どうなっても知らねぇぞ？　刺激も二倍になるんだからな……=I don't care what happens to you. It's twice the stimulation...
無謀な奴は嫌いじゃねぇぞ、勢いだけで終わるなよ？=I don't mind a reckless guy. Don't let the momentum stop you, okay?
よし、こっちはいいぞ……オマエのタイミングで始めろ……=Okay, this one's good... You can start when you're ready...
なかなか面白いことになりそうだ……ほら、早く挿れろ……=It's going to be quite interesting... Come on, get it in...
オレは弄られるだけか……まぁ、いいだろ……=I'm just going to be played... Well, okay.
どっちが本命かは見りゃ分かるが……ちゃんとこっちも弄れよ？=I know which one is the real deal when I see it, but... Why don't you play with this one, too?
んぅ……一人ずつ相手にしやる……ってわけにはいかねぇか。=Hmmm... Can't take them on one by one... Can we?
たく、二対一なんて……付き合わされるこっちの身にもなれ。=I don't want to be the one who has to go out with you.
あぁ、この高まってく感じは嫌いじゃねぇ。おい、早く始めろ。=Oh, I don't mind this growing feeling. Hey, get on with it.
見れば分かるだろ？　こっちはもう、準備完了してるぞ？=You see what I'm talking about? We're ready to go, okay?
まぁ、そう固くなるな。お互い気持ちよくなるだけだ。=Well, don't get so hard. We're just trying to make each other feel better.
頑張れよ？　本気でオレを落とす気で来い。=Come on, man. Come on, you really want to bring me down.
おい、何考えてる？　今かなり、いい感じだったろうが。=Hey, what are you thinking? I thought you were in a pretty good mood.
オマエに任せるのはいいが、オレより気持ちよくできるのか？=I don't mind leaving it to you, but can you do it better than I can?
よし、次だ。休んでる暇なんてねぇぞ。=All right, next. There's no time to rest.
もっとだ。オレを落としたいなら、まだ全然足りてねぇぞ。=More. If you want me to fall, you haven't gone far enough.
んっ、オマエがいいならいいが……少し複雑な気分だな……=Hmm, I hope that's okay with you, but it's a little complicated...
変わった愛情表現だな。それだけオレに夢中ってことか？=That's an unusual expression of affection. Is that how crazy you are about me?
どうした？　震えてるぞ？　オレが怖いのか？=What's the matter? You're shaking. Are you scared of me?
余裕が無いのはお互い様って感じか？　笑えるな。=So it's like we can't afford each other? That's funny.
よし、とりあえずオレに任せろ。悪い様にはしねぇからよ。=All right, leave it to me for now. I won't let anything bad happen to you.
じゃ、始めるぞ？　流石に覚悟はできてんだろ？=Let's get started, shall we? You're ready for this, aren't you?
やってやるさ。オマエと違って、オレの尻は綺麗だからな。=I'll do it. Unlike you, I have a beautiful ass.
お掃除して欲しいのか？　ほんと、こういうこと好きだよな。=You want me to clean it for you? You really like doing this, don't you?
いいね、好きなら関係ねぇって感じか？　ほら、早くキスしろ。=That's nice. What does it matter if you like it? Come on, give me a kiss.
さぁ、挿れてみろ……もう十分濡れてるからな……=Come on, get it in me, I'm already wet.
ほら、尻だってちゃんと入るから……安心して入れろ。=See, even my ass can fit in there... So don't worry about it.
はぁっ、そろそろか？　中か外か、どっちに出したいんだ？=Huh, is it time? Do you want it inside or outside?
オレのオマエの汁が混ざってるからな。よーく味わっておけ。=It's mixed with my own juices. Taste it carefully.
おい、そろそろ交代だ。オレに攻めさせろ。=Hey, it's time for a change. Let me attack.
三人ですんのはいいが……オマエら喧嘩すんなよ？=It's fine if it's just the three of you, but don't fight, okay?
オレは一人しかいねぇんだ……公平にってのは難しいぞ？=There's only one of me... And it's hard to be fair, okay?
とりあえずはオマエに任せる。好きにしてみろ。=I'll leave it to you for now. Do what you want.
いいか？　まずはオレを気持ちよくすることだけ考えろ。=Okay? You just think about making me feel good first.
今更になってビビるなよ？　オレをとことん楽しませろ。=Don't freak out now, okay? Let me have all the fun I can.
期待してるぞ。オマエがどこまで、オレを乱れさせるか。=I'm counting on you. Let's see how far you can take me.
焦らしてるつもりか？　あまり上手いとは言えないな。=Are you trying to rush me? You're not very good at that.
上手くやれよ？　オレより下手だったら、笑ってやるぞ？=Do it well, okay? If you're not as good as me, I'll laugh at you.
やるぞ。まさか、簡単に終われるなんて思ってないよな？=Let's do this. You don't think this is going to be easy, do you?
ようやく身体があったまってきた。ここからが本番だな。=My body finally warmed up. This is where the real work begins.
いいのか？　オレの匂いは、結構濃いぞ？=Are you sure? My scent is pretty strong, you know?
いい心がけだな。オレの全てで興奮するといい。=That's a good idea. You should be excited by all of me.
さぁ、お楽しみの時間だ。少しの間は、好きにさせてもらうぞ。=Now it's time for the fun part. I'll let you do whatever you want for a little while.
まぁそう緊張するな。ヤってみれば、一瞬だと思うぞ？=Well, don't be so nervous. It'll only take a second to get it over with, don't you think?
よぅし、準備はできてるな？　まぁ、できてなくても始めるが。=All right, are we ready? Well, we can start even if you're not.
この始める前の独特の感じはいいな。オマエもそう思うだろ？=I like this particular feeling before I start. You think so too, don't you?
オレの尻の味を知れってか？　上等だよ。=You want to know what my ass tastes like? You're welcome.
お掃除フェラってやつか。まぁ、普通はして欲しいもんだよな。=It's called a cleaning blowjob. Well, you usually want me to do it.
口の中にオマエのが少し残ってるからな、分けてやろうか？=I've got a little bit of yours in my mouth, you want me to share it with you?
ハッ、みっともないくらい濡れてるな……ほら、早く入れろ。=Haha, you're disgustingly wet... Come on, get it in.
尻でしたいんだろう？　ほら、今なら挿れもいいぞ……=You want it in my ass, don't you? Come on, you can have it now...
んっ、好きなところに出していいが、先に言うのがマナーだぞ？=Hmm, you can put it out wherever you want, but it's good manners to tell me first, okay?
フッ、悪くないな。オレが喜ぶことを分かってるじゃねぇか。=Not bad, huh? You know what makes me happy, don't you?
変われ。オレに受けは合わない。やはり攻めてこそだろう。=Change. Being on the receiving end is not for me. You have to be on the offensive, after all.
上等だ……二人がかりで、オレを落としてみろよ……=It'll take two of you to drop me.
こういう無茶は嫌いじゃねぇ……いいぞ、二人まとめて来い。=I don't mind this kind of recklessness... Okay, you two come together.
よし、オレはいつでもいいぞ。オマエのタイミングで来い。=Okay, I'm ready to go. Come when you're ready.
その顔、ごちゃごちゃ悩んでるな？　とにかく好きにやってみろ。=That look on your face, it's bothering you, isn't it? Anyway, go ahead and do what you want.
全部任せた。オレが喜ぶことなら、何でもやっていいぞ。=I'll take care of everything. You can do whatever makes me happy.
はぁっ、勝手に息が荒くなりやがる。オレも大概だな。=Huh, he's breathing hard on his own. I'm not so bad.
おもしれぇことを考えるな。いいぞ、やってみろ。=Don't even think about it. All right, go ahead.
ほう、普通にするより難しいぞ？　しっかりやれよ？=Wow, that's harder than normal, huh? Just make sure you do it right, okay?
ここで一度止めるなら、次はもっと気持ちよくなるんだろうな？=If I stop once here, I'll feel better the next time, right?
よし、ようやくその気になったか。待たせ過ぎなんだよ。=Okay, you're finally getting around to it. I've been waiting too long.
ほら、もう十分休んだろ？　まだまだ終わらねぇぞ。=Come on, you've had enough rest. It's not over yet.
折角なんだ。こういうことは、ぶっ壊れるくらいやらねぇとな。=It's a good opportunity. This kind of thing needs to be done to the point of destruction.
おいおい、小便の匂いで発情したのか？　まるでケモノだな。=Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're like a beast.
キスだけでいいのか？　別に啜ってくれてもいいんだぞ？=You want to just kiss me? You don't mind if I sip on it, do you?
どう攻められたいかってのはだいたい分かる。任せておけ。=I can almost always tell how I want to be attacked. I'll leave it to you.
痛かったりしたら言えよ？　そういうのが好きなら別にいいが。=If it hurts, just tell me, okay? If you like that kind of thing, fine.
よし、オマエを攻めるってのも、なかなか悪くない気分だ。=Okay, attacking you is not a bad feeling.
普通に考えたら、まぁオレが攻めだよな。仕方ねぇことだ。=If you think about it, I'm usually the aggressor, right? It can't be helped.
面白いことを考えるな。オレが尻の匂いくらいでビビるかよ。=That's a funny thing to think about. I'm not going to be scared off by the smell of my ass.
感謝しろよ？　このオレが綺麗にしてやるんだ。=You should be thanking me. I'm gonna get you cleaned up.
オマエも知るといい。オレはこんな臭いものを飲んでるだぞ。=You should know that. I'm drinking this stinky stuff.
あぁ……これは一気に、奥まで入っちまいそうだな……=I think I'm going to have to go all the way in...
おい、尻に入れてみろ……ほぐれてるから大丈夫だ。=Hey, put it in my ass... It's loosened up, you'll be fine.
んくっ、どこに出したい？　やっぱり中か？　別にいいぞっ！=Where do you want it? Is it inside? I don't care!
出した直後で興奮してるのか？　オマエのも混ざってるぞ？=Are you excited because you just got out? You've got some of yours mixed in.
よし、疲れて攻めがぬるくなる前に、オレが変わってやる。=All right, I'll change things up before you get tired and lukewarm.
まぁ、少しくらい乱暴な方が、やり甲斐があるってもんだ……=Well, the more violent you get, the more rewarding it is...
ほら来いよ……オレはビビったりしねぇぞ？=Come on, I'm not scared of you, okay?
ほう……一気に二人を相手か……面白そうじゃねぇか……=Well... Taking on two people at once... That sounds interesting...
ハッ、こいつは流石に……身体がもつか危ういな……=I don't know if I can handle this...
おい、さっさとしろ。こっちは色々我慢してやってるんだ。=Hey, get on with it. I've put up with a lot.
ビビって終わりなら、そっちの方が助かるが……どうなんだ？=If you're scared and that's the end of it, that's more helpful, but... What do you think?
何したってオマエは嫌われてんだ。逆に気が楽だろう？=No matter what you do, they'll always hate you. On the contrary, it makes you feel better, doesn't it?
くだらねぇことはすんなよ？　自分のことは二の次にしろ。=Don't do anything stupid, okay? Put yourself second.
動けない相手には強気か……クズの見本みたいな奴だな。=You're so tough on people who can't move... You're the epitome of a scumbag.
はぁ……動けりゃオマエなんか、ぶっ飛ばしてやるのにな……=If I could move, I'd kick my ass...
恥をかきたいなら勝手にしろ。オレは笑ってやるだけだ。=If you want to embarrass yourself, go ahead. I'll just laugh at you.
ハッ、オマエが小便好きの変態だと、言いふらしてやるよ。=Ha, I'm going to tell everyone you're a piss-eating pervert.
いいか？　じっとしてろよ？　面倒かけさせんじゃねぇぞ？=All right? Just sit tight, okay? Don't give me any trouble, okay?
結局人任せか。まったく……とことんダメなやつだな。=In the end, it's up to others. You're a complete and utter mess.
おら、攻めてやるから、感謝しろよ？　礼儀を忘れんな？=Hey, I'm gonna attack you. You should be grateful, okay? Don't forget your manners, okay?
余計なことは考えなくていい。さっさとイケ。それで終わりだ。=You don't have to think about anything else. Just get on with it. That's it.
チッ、オマエの尻に入ってたもんじゃないだけマシだな……=Tsk, you're lucky it wasn't in my ass...
最悪な気分だ……こんな臭くて汚いモンにご奉仕なんてよ。=I feel awful... Serving this stinky, dirty thing.
オマエの出したもの、全部口に返してやろうか？=Do you want me to put back in your mouth everything you put out?
おい、挿れるならさっさとしろ。どんだけ待たせんだ……=Hey, if you're going to insert it, do it quickly. How long are you gonna keep me waiting...
ハッ、尻に入れるのは怖いか？　この臆病者めっ。=Ha, you afraid to put it in my ass? You're a coward.
おい、分かってんな？　中に出したりしたら、承知しねぇぞ？=Hey, you know what? If you come inside me, I'm not gonna let you.
きちんと綺麗にしろよ。オマエが汚したんだからな。=Make sure you clean it up. You're the one who made it dirty.
全然ダメだな、オマエの攻めは退屈だ。オレにやらせろ。=You're no good at all. Your attacks are boring. Let me do it.
はぁ……オマエと舐め合うとか……正に悪夢だな……=Licking you is a nightmare...
んぅ……気は進まないが……まぁ、やるだけやってやる……=Well, I'm not sure I'm up to it, but... Well, I'm up for it.
たく、レズ趣味に付き合わされるとか……今日は厄日だな……=Well, I guess I'm having a bad day...
レズで攻めたいとか、とことんオレとは相性が悪そうだな……=I don't think I'm a good match for you...
オレをこっちにしたのは間違いだな。オマエの判断ミスだ。=It was a mistake to put me here. It was a mistake in your judgment.
こんなヤツのだが……顔に乗るよりはまぁいいだろう……=It's from this guy... But it's better than getting in his face...
フッ、屁でしてやろうか？　それくらいの方が好きだろう？=Huh? You want me to fart on you? You'd like that better, wouldn't you?
苦しくなっても知らねぇぞ……オマエが望んだことだ……=I don't care if it hurts... It's what you wanted...
二人で奉仕しろなんて……どんだけオマエは偉いんだ？=How great can you be if you have to serve us both?
オマエのもんに、二人で奉仕する価値なんてねぇと思うが……=I don't think your stuff is worth the two of us serving...
覚悟はできてるか？　二人でとことん苛めてやるよ……=Are you ready for this? I'm gonna torment you both to no end...
オマエが望んだことだ……どうなっても文句言うなよ……？=This is what you wanted... So don't complain no matter what happens... Okay?
オレにばっか夢中になって、もう一人を放置するなよ？=Don't get so carried away with me that you leave the other one behind, okay?
ちゃんと動けるのか？　そんな器用そうには見えねぇけどな。=Can you move properly? You don't look like you're that handy.
どっちもちゃんとできないようなら、すぐ終わりだかんな？=If you can't do either of those things properly, it's over soon, right?
おい、こういう時は公平が大事だぞ？　分かってるな？=Hey, fairness is important in a situation like this, okay? You know that, right?
二対一で嬲ろうなんて……オマエらにプライドはねぇのか？=Two against one... Don't you guys have any pride?
群れねぇと女も襲えねぇのか？　このヘタレ共め……=You can't even attack a woman unless you're in a group? You stupid bastards...
ちゃんと練習してきたか？　マンネリなのは勘弁だぞ？=Have you been practicing? You don't want to get stuck in a rut, do you?
よし、オマエがどれだけ上手くなったか、オレが見てやる。=Okay, I'll see how well you do.
いいか？　手抜きすんなよ？　オレにはすぐに分かるかんな？=All right? Don't cut corners, okay? I'll figure it out soon enough, won't I?
おい、調子に乗り過ぎだ。オレはオマエの女じゃねぇんだぞ。=Hey, you're getting carried away. I'm not your girl, you know.
分かった。オマエ、女には嫌われるタイプだな。=Okay, okay. You're the type of guy that women don't like.
全部オマエ任せか……ヤるならしっかりやれよ。=It's all up to you... If you're going to do it, do it right.
フッ、そのデカくしてるもんで、今ならやりたい放題だぞ……=Huh, you can do whatever you want with that big thing now...
待て、このタイミングでそれは無いだろうが。ヘタクソ。=Wait, that's not gonna happen at this time. You suck.
なんだ？　我慢できなくなったのか？　仕方ないやつだ。=What is it? You can't take it anymore? I can't avoid it.
さて、もう一回だ。まだまだオレはいけるぞ。=Okay, one more time. I'm still good.
おい、やるぞ。まさかもう満足したなんて言わねぇよな？=Come on, let's do it. You're not gonna tell me you're satisfied now, are you?
オマエはオレの小便を舐めたいのか？　変態だな。=You want to lick my piss? You're a pervert.
そうか、オマエはキスで啜りたいのか。面白いやつだな。=Oh, so you want to sip it with a kiss? You're a funny guy.
よし、ヤるぞ。オレは気が短いんだ。ぐずぐずするなよ。=Okay, let's do it. I'm short-tempered. Don't dawdle.
余計なことは考えるな。全部オレに任せときゃいい。=Don't think about anything else. Just leave everything to me.
オレの好きにやらせてもらうぞ。文句はないな？=I'm going to do whatever I want. You have no problem with that?
ほう、掃除しろってか？　オレの尻はそんなに汚くねぇぞ。=Oh, you want me to clean it? My ass is not that dirty.
いいだろう。オマエの精液を、味わってやるよ。=All right. I'm going to taste your semen.
なんだ？　オマエも自分の精液が飲みたくなったか？=What is it? You want to drink your own semen?
随分でかくなってるじゃねぇか。もう入れたくてたまらねぇか？=It's getting pretty big, isn't it? You can't wait to get it in there, can you?
無駄に大きくしやがって。まぁ、楽しめそうではあるな。=What a waste of space. Well, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
尻に入れたがるなんて、オマエは変態ってことで決定だな。=I'm pretty sure you're a pervert for wanting to put it in my ass.
オレの尻はかなり締まるぞ？　すぐにイったりするなよ？=My ass is pretty tight, okay? Don't make me come too soon, okay?
ほら、オマエのモンを食ってやるぞ。感謝しろよ？=Here, I'll eat your food. You should thank me.
オマエが溜めてきたモン全部、オレが吐き出させてやる。=I'm going to make you let out everything that you've accumulated.
よし、オレの尻で可愛がってやる。少しは楽しませろよ？=Okay, I'm gonna make you pretty with my ass. Let me have a little fun, huh?
尻の方が締まりがいいぞ。ちゃんと硬くしとけよ？=My ass is tighter than mine. Make sure it's hard, okay?
さあ、早いとこ挿れちまえ……焦らされるのは性に合わねぇ。=I don't like to be rushed.
ん……尻がヒクつきやがる……オマエのが早く欲しいってよ。=My ass is tingling... She wants yours fast.
ほらどうする？　中に出したいのか？　それとも外か？=Here, what do you want? You want it in or out? Or out?
自分で出したものを掃除するなんて、殊勝な心掛けだな。=You have an auspicious mind to clean what you put out.
よし、オレに任せろ。泣く程気持ちよくしてやるよ。=Okay, I'll take care of it. I'll make you feel so good you'll cry.
ハッ、ただ痛くするだけなんて、自己満足の極みだな……=Ha, just making it hurt is the height of self-satisfaction...
痛いくらいじゃビビらねぇが、何のためにするかは疑問だな=I ain't freaked out if it hurts, but I doubt I'd do it for nothing.
はぁ……だからオマエはヘタクソって言われんだよ。=That's why they say you're a bad shot.
オモチャとしての役目を果たせ。それくらい根性見せろ。=Do your job as a toy. Show that much guts.
まだまだ、オマエへの躾は、こんなもんじゃ終わんねぇよ。=This is not the end of my discipline for you yet, you know.
ほら掃除しろ。オマエのために汚してやったんだ。=Come on, clean it up. I made it dirty for you.
舐め合うのはいいが……途中で止まったりするなよ？=You can lick each other... But don't stop in the middle of it, okay?
期待で大きくしすぎだろ……そんなに舐め合いたいのか？=You're making it too big with your expectations... Do you really want to lick each other that badly?
オレが気持ちよくしてやるよ……忘れられない程にな……=I'm going to make you feel so good you'll never forget it.
フッ、相手が女だろうが……オレは容赦しねぇぞ？=I don't care if it's a woman... I'm not going to let you get away with it.
フッ、オマエに攻めさせてやる……オレを感じさせてみろ……=I'll let you attack me, let me feel you.
感じる所は分かってるだろ？　あとは攻め方次第だぞ……=You know what I'm talking about. It's just a matter of how you attack it...
どっちも気持ちよくされたいとか……オマエらは贅沢だな……=You want to be made to feel good by both of them... You guys are so extravagant...
まぁ、二本あるわけだしな……どっちかって訳にはいかねぇか。=Well, there's two of them... It can't be one or the other, can it?
二人一気に入ってくるのか……こいつは重労働だな……=Two people coming in at once... This guy's hard work...
二本あって、穴も二つだ……まぁ、普通こうなるだろうな……=There's two of them, and two holes... Well, that's what usually happens...
オマエがどんだけ出来るか、お手並み拝見だな。=Let's see how good you can be.
おい、オレを落としたいなら、最初から本気で来いよ？=Hey, if you're going to drop me, why don't you start from the beginning and get serious?
緊張してんのか？　そんなんじゃ、オレの相手は務まらねぇぞ？=Are you nervous? You can't take me on like that.
好きにやってみればいい。後はオレが、評価するだけだ。=You can do whatever you want. All I have to do is evaluate it.
そういうのを独りよがりってんだ。覚えとけ。=That's called self-importance. Remember that.
自分だけ気持ちよけりゃいいのか？　最低だな。=You just want to feel good about yourself? That's disgusting.
ほら、好き放題やってみろ。オレは動けねぇんだからな。=Go ahead, do whatever you want. I can't move, you know.
オマエが動くしかねぇんだ。ちゃんとオレをイカせろよ？=You've got to move. Make me cum, okay?
おい、空気を読めねぇなら。セックスは上達しねぇぞ？=Hey, if you can't read the air. You're not gonna get any better at sex.
よし、今度はオマエの番だ。オレを満足させてみろ。=Okay, now it's your turn. Try to satisfy me.
ハッ、オマエに意識があるうちは、終われるなんて思うなよ？=Ha, don't think it's over while you're still conscious, okay?
さぁ、続けるぞ。そう簡単に終わっちゃ面白くねぇだろ？=Come on, let's keep going. It wouldn't be fun to end it so easily, would it?
なんだ、サービスがいいな。なにかご褒美が欲しいのか？=What a great service. Do you want some kind of reward?
そんなところにまでキスするなんて。服従の証か？=I can't believe you even kissed that part. Is that a sign of obedience?
少しは優しくしてやるよ。少しだけな。=I'll be a little nicer to you. Just a little bit.
オレの虜にしてやるよ。覚悟しておけ。=I'll make you my prisoner. Be prepared.
オレなしじゃいられない身体にしてやるよ。嬉しいだろ？=I'm going to make you a body you can't live without. Won't that make you happy?
どう攻められたい？　一応意見くらいは聞いてやるぞ？=How do you want to be attacked? I'll at least ask your opinion, okay?
例え尻に入ってたもんだろうと、オマエのだから舐めてやるんだ。　感謝しろよ？=Even if it's in my ass, it's yours to lick. You should be grateful.
お掃除フェラってやつか？　そうくると思ったよ。=Is that what you call a cleanup blowjob? I knew you'd come around.
精液を分けて欲しいのか？　欲張りなやつだな。=You want me to share my semen with you? You're a greedy bastard.
ゆっくり入れろなんて言わねぇ。好きに突っ込めばいい。=I'm not going to tell you to go slow. Just shove it in as far as you want.
入れる前からそんな震えてちゃ、すぐイっちまいそうだな。=If you're shaking like that before I put it in you, you're going to cum soon.
光栄に思え。オマエになら、尻を許してやってもいい。=You should be flattered. I'll forgive my ass if it's you.
さて、オレの尻をどこまで感じさせられる？=Now, how far can you make my ass feel?
オレの中は強烈だぞ？　ちゃんと射精を我慢しろよ？=It's very intense inside me, okay? I want you to hold back your ejaculation.
それなりのモンは持ってんだ。一緒に楽しもうぜ？=I've got the right stuff. Let's have some fun together, huh?
オマエのモンがどこまで届くか、オレの尻で計ってやる。=I'm going to use my ass to measure how far your monster can reach.
中折れとかすんじゃねぇぞ？　オレが一番萎えるやつだ。=Don't break it in the middle, okay? That's the one I'm going to lose the most.
ほら、セックスするぞ……お楽しみの時間だ……=Here, let's have sex... Time for some fun...
ほら、尻はもうほぐれてるぞ……オマエのを入れるためにな。=See, my ass is already loosened up for me to put yours in.
もうイクんだろう？　中か外か、早めに決めとけよっ。=You're going to cum, aren't you? Decide if you're going to cum inside or outside.
ちょうどよく混ざって良い感じになってるぞ。好きなだけ飲め。=It's a good mix, just right. Drink as much as you like.
おい、攻守交替だ。オマエに本物の攻めを教えてやる。=Hey, let's switch sides. I'm going to teach you a real offense.
オマエの変態趣味に付き合ってやるんだ、感謝しろよ？=You should be grateful that I'm willing to indulge your perverted tastes.
はぁ……好きにしろ……別に逃げたりしねぇよ……=I'm not going to run away...
フッ、オレと舐め合いたいなんて、面白いことを考えるな。=Huh, don't be so funny about wanting to lick me.
オレの汁で溺れさせてやるよ……それが望みだろう？=I'll drown you in my juices... Isn't that what you want?
よし、こっちはオレが喰ってやる……ありがたく思えよ？=Okay, I'll eat this one... Thank you.
こっちに選ばれたんなら……ちゃんと気持ちよくしてやるよ……=If you've chosen me, I'll make you feel good...
ほら、思い切り押し付けてやるから、ちゃんとやれよ？=Come on, I'm going to push you as hard as I can, so do it right, okay?
顔でオレの重さを感じられるなんて……オマエは幸せ者だな。=You're so lucky to be able to feel the weight of me on your face.
まぁ頑張れ……二人相手だ、負けて当然だろ……？=Well, good luck... Against two people, you deserve to lose.
フッ、オレを見過ぎだ……今は二人いるんだぞ？=Huh, you're looking at me too much... There's two of us now, okay?
少しはいいところ見せろよ？　こっちは二人もいるんだからな。=Why don't you show me a little respect? There's two of us over here, you know.
オマエがどれだけのモンか……オレ達で試してやるよ。=We'll see how good you really are.
わりぃな、コイツのモンはオレがもらっちまうぞ……=I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to take his stuff.
フッ、気持ちいいからって、あんまこっちばっか贔屓すんなよ？=Don't patronize me just because it feels good, okay?
いいか？　夢中になって、二人いるってことを忘れんなよ？=Okay? Don't get carried away and forget that there's two of us, okay?
太くない分しっかり動かせ……じゃなきゃオレは満足しねぇぞ。=If you don't, I won't be satisfied.
どっちが強くされてるとか……面倒なことは言うなよ？=Don't tell me which one of us is being made stronger... Or more troublesome, okay?
平等にする自信はねぇぞ……そこは納得しとけ？=I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make it equal... You understand that, right?
フッ、どっちのモンがオレを感じさせられるか、競争だな……=Huh, it's a race to see which one of you can make me feel better...
二人して大きくしやがって……入れられるこっちの身にもなれ。（仕方ないなぁという感じです）=(I feel like I have no choice)
ぬるいことすんなよ？　攻めるならとことんだ。=Don't be lax, okay? If you're going to attack, go all the way.
おい、中途半端が一番だせぇからな？　分かってんな？=Hey, halfway is the worst, okay? You know that, right?
好きなだけがっついてこい。オレは一切引いたりしねぇ。=Go ahead and gobble up as much as you want. I'm not going to back down at all.
オレを満足させるのは大変だぞ？　覚悟はできてんな？=You know how hard it is to satisfy me? Are you ready for this?
調子に乗りやがって。どうやら甘やかし過ぎたみてぇだな。=You're getting carried away. It looks like I spoiled him too much.
好き放題やりてぇんなら、オレはかなり不向きだぞ？=If you want to do whatever the hell you want, I'm not the guy for you, okay?
オレは動けないからな……ちゃんと感じさせろよ？=I can't move, so... Make me feel it, okay?
いい機会だ。オマエがどれくらいのもんか、見せてみろよ。=This is a good opportunity. Let's see what you're made of.
ったく、最悪なタイミングだな。少し考えれば分かるだろ？=God, that's the worst timing. A little thought would've gone a long way.
オレと変わるってことは、責任重大だぞ？　分かってるな？=If you change with me, it's a big responsibility. You know that, right?
オレはまだ全然満足してねぇ。足りねぇんだよ、まだまだな。=I'm not satisfied at all. It's not enough, it's not enough.
オマエがどうなろうが知ったことじゃねぇ。オレを満足させろ。=I don't care what happens to you. Satisfy me.
分かってるぞ。オレの濃い匂いが好きなんだろう？=I know you do. You like the way I smell, don't you?
この変態め。濃い匂いを嗅ぐと、キスしたくなるんだろ？=You pervert. You know that thick smell makes me want to kiss you, right?
よし、じっとしてろよ？　オレの攻めはちょっとキツめだぞ。=Okay, hold still, okay? I'm going to be a little hard on you.
さぁ、お楽しみの時間だ。主にオレのな。=Now it's time for the fun part. Mostly mine.
喜べ、俺がたっぷり犯してやる。気が狂う程にな。=Rejoice, I'm going to fuck you good. I'm going to fuck you like crazy.
壊れるなよ？　オレはとことんやるタイプだからな。=Don't break it, okay? I'm a go-getter.
オレが尻の味ごときでビビる思ったか？　舐められたもんだな。=Did you think I'd be intimidated by the taste of my ass? I've been licked.
嫌がると思ったか？　むしろトッピングが増えていいじゃねぇか。=Did you think I wouldn't like it? I'd rather have more toppings.
自分の精液まで飲みたがるなんて。やっぱり変態だな。=He even wants to drink his own semen. I knew he was a pervert.
ノロノロ入れんじゃねぇぞ？　一気に奥まで、ガツンと来い。=Don't slow it down. Go all the way in at once and hit me hard.
少しは長く楽しませろよ？　挿れてすぐ終わりなんて勘弁だぞ。=Let me enjoy this for a little while longer, okay? I don't want you to just stick it in and be done with it.
尻はかなり窮屈だぞ。気合いれて腰振れよ？=My ass is pretty tight. Shake your hips with gusto, okay?
ほら、ご自慢のモノで……オレの尻をイカせてみろ。=Go ahead, make my ass cum with your prized cock.
オマエの役目はずっと硬くしておくことだ。簡単だろう？=Your job is to keep it hard. Isn't that easy?
ほら、セックスを始めるぞ。オマエがぶっ壊れるまでヤってやる。=Come on, let's start the sex. I'm going to fuck you until you break.
オレの尻に慣れちまったら、もう他じゃ満足できねぇかもな。=Once you get used to my ass, you may never be satisfied with anything else.
期待通り、オマエのモンを尻でめちゃくちゃにしてやるよ。=As you can expect, I'm going to mess up your mon with my ass.
我慢するな……これだけ濡れてりゃ、一気に奥まで入るぞ。=Don't hold back... When you're this wet, you'll go all the way in.
一気に奥まで来い……尻はもう、十分ほぐれてるからな……=Come to the back at a stretch... But the ass is already enough...
おい、中か外かくらい、ちゃんと言ってから射精しろよ？=Hey, can you at least tell me if I'm in or out before you ejaculate?
自分から掃除しに来るなんて、よく分かってるじゃないか。=You know exactly what you're doing, coming here to clean up after yourself.
もっと気持ちよくなりたいだろう？　なら、後はオレに任せろ。=You want to feel better, don't you? Then leave the rest to me.
おい、痛くするしかできないのは、テクが無いのと一緒だぞ？=Hey, if all you can do is make it hurt, it's like having no tech, okay?
気持ちいい痛みなら歓迎だが……オマエにできんのか？=I'm all for a good pain, but can't you do it?
さて、じゃあどっちが先にイクか、勝負だな……=Okay, well, let's see who's gonna cum first...
ちゃんとオレのを舐めろよ？　やるならきっちりだぞ？=Why don't you lick mine? If you're gonna do this, do it right.
女同士なんだ、変な遠慮はしないで、好きなだけ感じろ……=We're women, don't be shy, feel as much as you want...
さぁ始めるか……女同士でも出来る、いやらしい事をよ……=Let's get started... With some girl-on-girl nasty...
ちゃんと攻めろよ？　オレはそう簡単には満足しねぇぞ？=I'm not going to be satisfied that easily. I'm not going to be satisfied that easily.
気持ち良ければ、何してもいいぞ……好きにやってみろ……=You can do whatever you want as long as it feels good... Do whatever you want...
ほら見ろ……オレの中に入りたくて、もうピクピクしてやがる。=Look at him... He's already jerking off to get inside me.
いい感じに勃起してんな……これなら十分楽しめそうだ……=You've got a nice erection... This should be fun enough...
フッ、顔騎か……これはこれで、面白そうだ……=Huh, face-planting... Well, this is going to be interesting...
顔中オレの匂いで満たされるんだ……最高だろ？=You can smell me all over your face... Isn't that great?
オレ達が容赦なく鳴かしてやる……良い声を聞かせろよ？=We're going to make you squeal without mercy, so let's hear it.
オマエが二人相手にどれだけ耐えられるか……楽しみだな。=I can't wait to see how long you can hold out against the two of us.
オレた達は楽しませてもらうが、オマエは大変かもなぁ。=We're going to have fun, but you're going to have a hard time.
さぁて、オレ等のオモチャになってもらおうか……=Now, let's see if we can get you to play with us...
太い方はオレか……これなら楽しめそうだ……=The fat one is me... And I think I'm going to enjoy this...
もうバキバキじゃねぇか……二人相手で興奮してんのか？=You're all cracked up... Are you excited about taking on two guys?
ご自慢のモンじゃなくてもどれだけできるか、試してやるよ……=I'll see how well you do without your prized mon...
一緒に動くなんてできんのか？　オレを退屈させんなよ？=Can't we just move together? Don't want to bore me, do we?
よし……オレがどっちも、面倒みてやるよっ……！=Okay, I'll take care of both of you...
まぁ、二人くらい余裕だろ……単純にイカせりゃいいだけだ。=Well, there's plenty of room for two... Just make them cum, that's all.
ほぅ……二本挿しか……ハッ、望むところだっ！=Oh... Double penetration... Ha, I wish!
中がすげぇことになりそうだな……オマエらビビんなよ？=It's going to be a real mess inside... Don't be scared, okay?
全力で来いよ？　オレは遠慮されるのが嫌いなんだ。=Come on, give it your all. I don't like to be held back.
何も気にするな。オレをめちゃくちゃにする勢いで来い。=Don't worry about a thing. Just come and mess me up.
オレに火を点けられたら大したもんだぞ。意地を見せろよ？=If you can light me up, you're doing great. Show some backbone, will ya?
さて、どんだけオマエが楽しませてくれるのか、見物だな。=Now, let's see how much fun you can be.
ハッ、面白いことを考えるな。いいぞ、やってみろ。=Ha, that's an interesting thought. All right, go ahead.
ほう、オレが好きそうなことを分かってるみてぇだな。=Well, it looks like you know what I like.
さぁ、オマエのもので、オレをどれだけ喘がせられるかな？=Now, let's see how much you can make me moan with yours.
何されても抵抗できないってのは、それはそれで燃えるな。=I can't resist no matter what they do to me, that's a burning thought.
はっ、ここで寸止めとか、お前にしては気が利くじゃねえか=Haha, you're very clever for stopping here.
我慢のできないやつだ。まぁ、攻められるのは嫌いじゃないが。=I can't stand it. Well, I'm not averse to being attacked.
おい、ヘバってんじゃねぇぞ？　こっからがいいとこなんだ。=Hey, don't screw this up, all right? This is where it gets good.
休憩なんてさせるかよ。お互いぶっ壊れるまでやるぞ。=I'm not going to let you take a break. We'll do it until we both break down.
まだビショビショだからな。好きなだけしゃぶっていいぞ。=I'm still soaking wet. You can suck on it as much as you want.
いいぞ、口を細めて、オレの小便を好きだけついばめばいい。=All right, squish your mouth shut and take all the piss you want from me.
手加減はしないぞ？　その方がオマエも嬉しいだろ？=I'll go easy on you, okay? It'll make you happy, right?
たまには攻めるのも悪くねぇ。マンネリが一番退屈だからな。=It's not bad to go on the offensive once in a while. A rut is the most boring thing in the world.
オマエに攻め方ってもんを教えてやるよ。身体で覚えてけ。=I'm going to teach you how to attack. Learn it with your body.
いい攻めってのはな、受けのことも知ってるからできるんだよ。=A good offense, you know, can be made by knowing the receiver as well.
分かってるじゃねぇか。奉仕するなら、匂いが濃い方がいい。=You know what I'm talking about. If you're going to serve me, you'd better have a strong smell.
オレは精液の匂いで発情するんだ。どうなっても知らねぇぞ？=I'm in heat from the smell of semen. I don't care what happens to you, okay?
キスしても精液はやらないぞ。全部オレのだからな。=You can kiss me, but you won't get any semen. It's all mine.
ほら、乱暴にぶっ込んでも文句は言わねぇ。思い切り来い。=Here, I won't complain if you take a rough shot. Come as hard as you can.
フッ、オマエのモンがどれ程のものか、オレが試してやる。=Huh, I'll test how good your monster is.
尻なら勝てるとか思うなよ。オレは尻も強いぞ。=Don't think you can win with my ass. I'm strong in the ass too.
尻好きなのは、オマエだけじゃねぇ。入れりゃすぐ分かるさ。=You're not the only one who likes ass. You'll find out soon enough.
チマチマやんのは性に合わないからな、一気に奥までいくぞ。=It's not in my nature to do it chick by chick. I'm going to go deep at once.
入れた瞬間に射精とかやめろよ？　オレは長く楽しみたいんだ。=Don't ejaculate the moment you put it in, okay? I want to enjoy it for a long time.
容赦はしねぇぞ？　オマエも尻を締めて頑張れよ？=I'm not gonna let you get away with this. Why don't you tighten my ass up?
おい、尻好きの変態には、手加減なんていらねぇよな？=Hey, you don't need to go easy on the ass-loving pervert, do you?
さぁ来い……オマエの滾ったモンを、全部受け止めてやるっ！=Come on... I'll take all your boiling!
さぁ、オレの尻をめちゃくちゃにしてみろ、準備は出来てるぞ。=Now, go ahead and fuck my ass up. I'm ready for you.
フッ、出すなら中ってか？　わかってんじゃねえか！=What do you mean, "inside"? You know what I'm talking about!
そうだ。自分で出したものくらい、きちんと掃除しないとな？=That's right. You've got to clean up after yourself, right?
まだオマエの攻めは少しぬるいな。オレが手本を見せてやる。=You're still a little lukewarm in your attack. I'll show you how it's done.
思い切りやっていいぞ……フッ、オレは頑丈だからな……=You can go all the way... Well, I'm tough...
オマエは分かってるな……そうだ、痛いくらいがいいんだ……=You know what I'm saying... Yes, the more it hurts, the better.
攻めも受けもどっちもってか……オマエは欲張りなやつだな。=You're a greedy bastard.
思い切り吸い付いてこいよ？　オレもそうするからな……=Why don't you go ahead and suck on it as hard as you can? I'll do the same...
女同士、遠慮は無しだ……思いっきり攻めて来い……=Woman to woman, no holds barred... Come at me with all your might...
少しくらい乱暴にしてもいいぞ……オレはそっちの方が好みだ。=You can be a little rough with it, I prefer it that way.
喜べ。上も下も、オレ等がめちゃくちゃに犯してやるよ……=Rejoice. We're gonna fuck you up, up and down...
ほら、オマエのために濡らしておいてやったぞ、感謝しろよ？=Here, I've wet it for you. You should be grateful.
苦しくなってもオレはどかねぇぞ？　窒息に気を付けろ？=I'm not going anywhere if you're in pain, okay? Watch out for choking, okay?
出てくるもんは全部舐めろよ？　オマエに選択権はねぇぞ？=Lick everything that comes out, okay? You don't have a choice, do you?
こっちは二人もいるんだ……ちゃんと最後まで硬くしておけよ？=There's two of us over here... Make sure you're hard to the end, okay?
女二人にご奉仕してもらうなんて……いいご身分だな……=Two women serving you... You're in good company...
好き放題やらしてもらうぞ……それがオマエの望みだろう？=I'll do whatever you want to me... Isn't that what you want?
二人でオマエをめちゃくちゃに出来ると思うと、濡れてくるな……=I'm getting wet just thinking about the two of us messing with you...
いいぞ、そのぶっといモンで、オレを思い切り突きまくれ……=All right, use that big dick of yours to pound me as hard as you can...
さぁ、誰が最初にイクかな……フッ、オレが少し不利か？=Now, let's see who's going to cum first... Huh, am I at a slight disadvantage?
太くなくても、要は動かし方次第だ……上手くやれよ？=It doesn't have to be thick, it just depends on how you move it... Make it work, okay?
こっちじゃ満足するのは難しそうだが……期待してるぞ？=It's going to be hard to satisfy you over here, but... We're counting on you, okay?
フッ、二人とも腰が抜けるまでしてやるぞ……覚悟しとけよ？=I'm going to do this to both of you until your backsides fall off... Are you ready?
二人でオレを攻めるんじゃねぇのか？　少し拍子抜けだな……=Aren't you two going to attack me? That's a little disappointing...
二人とも絶好調って感じか……なら、ちゃんと相手しねぇとな。=I guess we're both on a roll... Then we'll have to take care of each other.
一気に二人満足させるなら……これが一番手っ取り早いだろ。=If you want to satisfy two people at once this is the quickest way to do it.
おい、つまんねぇことだけはすんなよ？=Hey, don't be a dick, okay?
何したって同じだ、オマエが上手いと思うことなんてねぇよ。=It doesn't matter what you do, you're never going to be good at it.
最初から期待してねぇからな。逆にやりやすいだろ？=I'm not expecting it from the start. On the other hand, it's easy to do, right?
オレを退屈させたらそこで終わりだ。覚えとけよ？=If you bore me, that's the end of it. Remember that?
クソが……やっぱりオマエは最悪だ。=You're still the worst.
オマエ、一生モテねぇな。オレが保証してやる。=You'll never be popular. I'll guarantee it.
おい、早くしろ……まさか、動けねぇ相手にビビってんのか？=Hey, come on... You're not scared of a guy who can't move, are you?
オマエのオモチャ扱いか……たく……最悪だな……=You're treating me like a toy... You're the worst.
息を荒くしてんじゃねぇ。気持ち悪いんだよ。=Don't breathe so hard. It's disgusting.
オマエにキスなんかされても嬉しくもない。気持ち悪いだけだ。=I'm not even happy that you kissed me. It's just disgusting.
されるがままか？　楽な方に流されるオマエらしいな。=You're just going to let them do what they want? It's just like you to take the easy way out.
ジタバタすんなよ？　速攻で終わらせてやる。=Don't get jittery, okay? I'm going to finish this as fast as I can.
あんま時間かけても面倒だからな、即イカせるぞ？=If you take too long, it'll be too much trouble. I'll make you cum right away, okay?
ハッ、オマエなんか、適当にやってもどうせすぐイクだろ。=Haha, you'll probably cum sooner or later even if I do it just right.
オマエの尻と違ってオレのは綺麗だからな。何も問題ない。=Unlike my ass, mine is beautiful. There's nothing wrong with that.
自分で舐めたらどうだ？　掃除も一人できないのか？=Why don't you lick it yourself? Can't you clean up after yourself?
この臭くて汚らしいものを、全部オマエに返してやる。=I'm going to give all this stinky, filthy stuff back to you.
早くその汚ぇモンを入れろ。見てるだけで吐き気がする。=Get that filthy thing in here. I'm getting nauseous just looking at it.
どうせ、挿れて即射精だろ？　早漏なんてレベルじゃねぇな。=You're gonna ejaculate right after I put you in there, aren't you? Premature ejaculation is not even close.
汚ぇモンは汚ぇところで相手しねぇとな。それが礼儀ってもんだ。=You have to deal with dirt in a dirty place. That's what politeness is all about.
オマエみたいな心が汚ぇやつ程、尻に入れたがるんた。=The dirtier your mind is, the more you want to put it in my ass.
ほら、泣いて喜べ。オマエのクソみたいなモンを入れてやる。=Here, cry for joy. I'll put your shit in it.
よく覚えとけ。これが人生最後の挿入になるかもしれないぞ？=Remember that. This could be the last time you ever insert anything in your life, okay?
オレの尻で、オマエに情けない声を出させてやるよ。=I'm going to make you make a pathetic sound with my ass.
ハッ、尻でしたいなんて思えなくなるくらい、苛め抜いてやるよ。=Ha, I'm going to torment you so much that you won't want to do it in the ass anymore.
なにをぐずぐずしてる……オレとセックスするのが怖いのか？=What are you waiting for... Are you afraid to have sex with me?
ようやく入れる気になったか……尻が待ちくたびれちまったぞ。=You're finally ready to put it in... My ass is getting tired of waiting.
気持ち悪い声出してねぇで。どこに出すかくらいはっきりしろ。=Don't make creepy noises. At least tell me where to put it.
早く綺麗にしろ。オマエの匂いが付いたらどうしてくれる？=Come on, clean it up. What if I get your scent on me?
ダメだ。オマエに任せてたんじゃ。埒が明かねぇ。=No, no, no. You can't just leave it to me. I can't get anywhere.
おい、やるなら早く始めろ。オマエの方がビビってどうする。=Hey, if you're going to do this, you better get started. You're the one who's freaking out.
この変態め……こんなことでしか興奮できないのか？=You pervert... Is this the only way you can get off?
ハッ、どうせオマエは、一人で喘いで動けなくのがオチだな。=You're going to be stuck panting all by yourself anyway.
期待はしてねぇが……サボったりしたら分かってんな？=I won't hold my breath, but you know what they say about skipping work, right?
オレの攻めはキツいぞ？　がっかりさせんなよ？=You know how hard I can be on you? Don't let me down, okay?
イキたきゃイキゃいいが、オレが満足するまでは終わらねぇぞ？=You can cum all you want, but it won't be over until I'm satisfied, okay?
はぁ……オマエが攻めか……不安しかねぇな……=Huh... You're the aggressor... You're making me nervous...
しっかり攻めろよ……ビビってちゃ、話にならねぇぞ……=If you're too scared to attack, you'll never get anywhere.
オレにこっちを任せたら……オマエ、まともに動けなくなるぞ？=If you let me do this you'll never be able to move properly.
そうか、オレにこっちを苛めて欲しいか……いい選択だな……=Well, you want me to torment you... Good choice...
顔を潰されたくなかったら、余計なことはすんじゃねぇぞ？=If you don't want to get your face smashed in, don't do anything you shouldn't have.
オマエの顔に乗るとか……二人じゃなかったら絶対しねぇな。=I would never ride on your face if we weren't together.
途中で許して欲しい時は、ちゃんと二人に言うんだぞ？=If you need forgiveness along the way, just tell us both, okay?
さて、オレ等でコイツをめちゃくちゃにしてやるか……=Now, let's see if we can mess this up...
どれだけオマエがみっともなくなるか、二人でじっくり見てやる。=We're going to take a good look at you and see how disgusting you've become.
欲張った奴の最後ってのは、大概ロクなことにならねぇぞ？=The last thing that happens to greedy people is usually a disaster.
土壇場でビビんなよ？　二人とも満足させるのが役目だぞ。=Don't freak out at the last minute, okay? You're supposed to keep us both happy.
まぁこっちなら、いくらヘタレ相手でも少しは感じるだろ……=Well, I'm sure you'll feel a little bit of it here, no matter how badass you are...
さて、お手並み拝見だ……まぁ、見るまでもなさそうだが……=Well, let's see what you've got... Well, I guess I don't need to see it...
オレがこっちか……随分安く見られたもんだな……=I'm over here... And I'm being looked at so cheaply...
二人揃って奉仕して欲しいとか……オマエらヘタレ過ぎだろ。=You want us both to serve you... You're too much of a pussy.
たく……さっさと終わらせるぞ。オマエら、変な意地張るなよ？=Let's just get this over with. Don't be so stubborn, okay?
ほら、もう面倒だから……まとめてかかってこい。=Come on, it's already too much trouble... Just put it together and come at me.
二本あるから、同時に入れたい……つくづく単純な奴らだな。=There are two of them, so I want to put them in at the same time... They're really simple people, aren't they?
こんなとこりにキスして欲しいのか？　性癖が歪んでるな。=You want me to kiss this lump? Your sexuality is so twisted.
ほら、喜べ。こっちにキスしてやるぞ。=Come on, be happy. I'm going to kiss you.
キスされるのを期待してるのか？　ビクビクしてるぞ？=Are you expecting me to kiss you? You're freaking out, okay?
こら、反り返らせるな。キスし辛いだろうが。=Hey, don't make me bend over. You're making it hard to kiss.
なんでオマエにキスなんか。変な勘違いをするなよ？=I don't know why I'm kissing you. Don't make any weird mistakes, okay?
おい、しっかりやれよ？　ぬるいことすんじゃねぇぞ？=Hey, come on, man. Don't be lax, all right?
オレをイカせられたらご褒美だ。気合入れろよ？=If you can make me cum, that's your reward. Put your mind to it, will you?
やりたきゃやれ。後でどうなっても知らねぇがな。=If you want to do it, do it. I don't care what happens later.
些細な反撃ってやつか？　いいぞ、やってみろよ。=You call that a petty counterattack? All right, go for it.
さぁ、全部オマエ次第だぞ……オレを満足させてみろ。=Now, it's all up to you... To satisfy me.
オマエがどれだけオレを感じさせられるか、楽しみだな……=I can't wait to see how much you can make me feel...
ここで体位を変えるとか、オマエ……オレを舐めてんのか？=Do you think you're licking my chops by changing positions here?
いいだろう。攻めさせてやる。オレに欲望をぶつけてみろ。=All right. I'll let you attack me. Give me what I want.
まだまだだ。一日中ヤっても、足りる気がしねぇ。=It's not enough. I don't think it's enough, even if I fuck all day.
とことん付き合ってもらうぞ。オマエはオレのものなんだからな。=You're going to be with me the whole way. You're mine, you know.
フッ、嬉しいだろう？　オレの小便をたくさん飲めて。=Huh, aren't you glad? Drinking a lot of my piss.
よし、キスでオレの小便を啜れ。=Okay, sip my piss with a kiss.
喜べ、オレが喰ってやる。じっとしてろ。=Rejoice, I will eat you. Sit tight.
どう苛めて欲しい？　まともに扱ってもらえるなんて思うなよ？=How do you want me to torment you? Don't expect them to treat you right, okay?
ケツに入ってたモンだろうと、オレはしゃぶりたきゃしゃぶるぞ。=I'll suck it if I want to, even if it's in my ass.
ほら、チンポ汁を寄越せ。もったいねぇだろうが。=Here, give me your dick juice. It's a waste of money.
ほら、自分の精液の匂いくらい、ちゃんと覚えとけ。=Come on, you should at least remember what your semen smells like.
いい感じに勃起してるな。ほら、早くぶちこめ。=You've got a nice erection. Come on, get it in there.
もう我慢汁垂らしてるのか？　この早漏め。=Are you already dripping in your own juices? You premature ejaculator.
ほら、ケツ穴でさせてやる。感謝しろよ？=Here, let me do it in my asshole. You should be thanking me, huh?
ケツ穴思い切り締め付けてやるからな。簡単には抜けねぇぞ。=I'm going to squeeze my asshole as hard as I can. You won't be able to pull it out easily.
オレのマンコで貪ってやる。溜めてるもん全部吐き出せ。=I'm going to devour you with my cunt. Spit out everything you have stored up.
覚悟しろ。一度マンコに入れちまったら。もう止まんねぇぞ。=Be prepared. Once it's in my pussy. You won't be able to stop now.
オマエが泣くまで、ケツ穴で苛めてやるよ。=I'm going to torment you with my asshole until you cry.
おい、もっと勃起させろ。オレのケツ穴が満足するようにな。=Hey, give me a bigger boner. Make sure my asshole is satisfied.
いいぞ。どんだけマン汁が溢れてくるか、試してみろ。=That's good. Let's see how much pussy juice you can get.
ケツ穴なら十分ほぐれてるぞ。今なら何でも飲み込めそうだ。=My asshole is well loosened up. I think I can swallow anything now.
ほら、中に出せ。オマエの精液は、全部オレのものだ。=Come on, get it in there. All of your semen is mine.
マンコの掃除は任せたぞ？　丁寧にやれよ？=I got my cunt cleaned, okay? Just be careful, okay?
よし、後はオレに任せろ。頭が狂うくらい、気持ちよくしてやる。=Okay, I'll take care of the rest. I'll make you feel so good that you'll go crazy.
痛くするだけじゃ許さねぇぞ……ちゃんとオレをイカせろ。=I'm not going to let you just make me hurt... Make me cum.
オマエの我儘に付き合ってやるんだ。感謝しろよ？=I'm giving in to your selfishness. You should be grateful.
舐め合いか……面白い、オマエを骨抜きにしてやる。=Licking each other... Interesting, I'm going to bone you.
期待してるぞ。オレによがらされるだけで終わるなよ？=I'm counting on you. Don't just end up getting fucked by me, okay?
オレに任せておけ、女の扱いなら、分かってる……=I'll take care of it. I know how to handle a woman...
好きなだけ喘いでいいぞ、オマエのエロい声を聞かせろ……=You can moan as much as you want, let me hear your sexy voice...
さて、女同士なんだ……妙な遠慮は無しで頼むぞ……=Now, woman to woman... No need to be so coy...
いいか？　男なんかじゃできねぇくらい、オレを気持ちよくしろ。=You know what? I want you to make me feel better than I ever could with a man.
まぁ、オマエのを喰うなら、俺が一番適任だろうな……=Well, if I'm going to eat you, I'm probably the best person for the job...
オレのマンコの形と感触、温度に味。全部覚え込ませてやる。=The shape, feel, temperature, and taste of my pussy. I'm going to make you remember everything.
フッ、オレを見過ぎだ……一応二人いるんだぞ？=You're looking at me too much... There's two of us, remember?
オマエはすぐ、オレの虜になる……そういう風に決まってる。=You're going to be my prisoner soon, that's how it's going to be.
さぁ、オレの中に入ってこい……遠慮は一切いらねぇぞ……=Now, come inside me... And don't be shy at all...
ちゃんと感じさせられなかったら……おしおきだからな……？=If I can't make you feel it properly, I'll have to punish you, okay?
二人だろうが問題ねぇ……まとめて相手してやるよ。=I don't care if it's two of you... I'll take care of them all together.
さぁ、仲良く二人で……オレを感じさせてみろ……=Come on, you and me, just the two of us... Make me feel...
キスしてやる。オマエは動くな。=I'll kiss you. You don't move.
んぅ……ころぜつりんめ……おぇをころしゅきか……（この絶倫め、オレを殺す気か？）=(Are you trying to kill me, you immortal?)
あー……すきにしお……おぇはうごけれぇぞ……（好きにしろ、オレは動けねぇぞ）=(Do what you want. I'm not moving)
んぐ……まらしゅうろか……あらまがおかひぃんじゃらいのか。（まだするのか。頭がおかしいんじゃないのか）=(Do you still do that? You're out of your mind.
ぁー……わかっら……おまぁはしゅごい……みろめれやう……（分かった。オマエはすごい、認めてやる）=(Okay, okay. You're awesome, I'll give you that.
まれ……もうむぃら……せめれ……ひとりじゅつ……（待て、もう無理だ。せめて一人ずつ）=(Wait, I can't do this anymore. At least one at a time.
おまぇら……ふたぃにしれも……げんきがあぃすぎらろ……（オマエら、二人にしても元気があり過ぎだろ）=(You two are too energetic for your own good)
んぁー……なんらぁー……んぅー、きもひぃころすぅろかぁ……（なんだ、気持ちいいことするのか？）=(What, are you going to do something pleasant?)
んふぅ……しっかぃやぇお……おぇはちゅよいじょぉ……（しっかりやれよ。オレは強いぞ）=(Do it well) I'm strong.
あ゛ー……もうぢぬぅ……んぅぅ……あらまぷちぷちしゅゆぅ……（もう死ぬ。頭プチプチする。）=(I'm dying. I'm dying.
